# PDF-extraction

As part of a File I/O project, I developed a PDF-to-text converter and analysis tool using Java, specifically utilizing the PDFbox API. This project showcases my skills in File I/O and Java programming.

File I/O: I created a Java program to extract text from PDF files, preserving data integrity.
PDFbox API: Leveraging the PDFbox API, I seamlessly processed PDFs into readable text, ensuring compatibility with course requirements.
Text Formatting: I designed a Java program to format the extracted text according to specific guidelines, improving readability.
Data Analysis: I implemented an application for text analysis, allowing users to search for common words, check for specific terms, and identify document sections.
