Abstract - An examination has been made of the heat production at ten palladium
electrodes, each prepared in a different way. Seven of these produced heat during
D2 evolution in a D2-O2 electrolysis cell (no recombination attempted) which
coincided precisely with the prediction of classical electrochemical theory, and
thus eliminated the suspicion of heat through unintended D2-O2 recombination.
Three electrodes clearly produced an excess heat of ~2-5 watts-cm-3. The heat was
observed for periods of 10-33 hrs. In one electrode the excess heat production
“shut off” (after 33 hrs) with no apparent cause: it did not return in five days of
further electrolysis.
Fleischmann and Pons [1] reported the production of heat during the electrolysis of D2O at a
Pd cathode and Pt anode in excess of that predicted by the electrochemical theory for the heat
production in cells. Some of the measurements even indicated that the total energy out of the cell
as heat was greater than that going in as electricity. The paper attracted attention because it was
suggested that the excess heat was due to D-D fusion occurring in Pd at high overpotential. A
principal difficulty, since the announcement in March 1989, has been that many
electrochemically inexperienced investigators have tried, but failed, to reproduce the alleged heat
(however, cf. Huggins [2], Landau [3], McKubre [4], Appleby and Srinivasan [5], Wadsworth
[6]).
In this note, we report the observation of this excess heat effect in three electrodes out of ten
prepared and examined.
The calorimeter used in the study was of the heat transfer type. The cell is a glass cylinder 10
cm. high and 5 cm in diameter. The cap is made of 1 cm thick Teflon with holes for the
electrodes, the Joule heater and the temperature probe. The cell is placed inside another glass
cylinder 12 cm. high and 7 cm. in diameter. For good heat transfer the space between the
cylinders is filled with ethylene glycol. The assembly is immersed in a constant temperature bath
(0.01°C accuracy) and the temperature difference between the bath and the cell is monitored with
thermistor thermometers (Omega 700 series thermistors with 0.01°C resolution).
The calorimeter was calibrated by passing different amount of direct current through the
electric heater (resistance 275 Ω) in the solution of 0.1 M LiOD (made by dissolution of Li in
D2O) and noting the potential drop across it. For each value of the electrical power put in, steady
state temperature difference (monitored on a y-t recorder) was noted and plotted to yield a
2
calibration curve as shown in Fig. 1. This curve was repeatedly reestablished by several of the
authors of this paper and found to be stable to within ±0.05 watts.
The 99.9% pure Pd rods, cast in a ZrO2 crucible and drop hammered during production by
Hoover and Strong, Richmond, VA, were obtained from Texas Coin Exchange. They were cut
into 2.5 - 4.0 cm lengths. Nickel wire (0.38 mm diameter) was spot welded to the electrode to
make connection to the power supply. The electrodes were charged in glass test-tubes for 18 - 30
days at current density 60 mA-cm-2. During charging Ni mesh was used as an anode while in the
calorimeter Pt wire spiral was used. The electrodes had been pre-treated in various ways as
shown in Table 1.

The electrodes were moved from the charging cells to the calorimeter in a minimum amount of
time and the current density Increased to >300 mA-cm-2. After attainment of steady state, the
temperature difference was noted and the current density was varied from 100-500 mA-cm-2. The
temperature difference was plotted as a function of the rate of heat dissipation in the cell,
calculated according to the equation:
West = (E-1.54)×I (1)
where: E - cell voltage, [V], I - current, [A], 1.54 - the thermoneutral potential for heavy water.
This formula is valid when no recombination reaction takes place in the cell and the only
chemical transformation is the splitting of D2O. In a separate experiment the total volume of the
gases evolved was measured at several current densities and observed to correspond to 100%
(within ± 1%) current efficiency for gas evolution i.e., no recombination of D2 and O2. During
the calorimetric measurements the experiments were watched continuously. D2O was added to
the cell to maintain the solution level constant and no part of the Pd electrode was allowed to be
outside the solution. The Pt wire from the counterelectrode was encased in Teflon sleeve.
In most of the cases, including Pt in LiOD solution, the points corresponding to West and ΔT
were exactly on the calibration graph. However, for samples B9 and B8 the points were
decisively (up to 1.1 watts) above heat production values indicated by the calibration curve
showing that the rate of heat production was above that estimated from equation (1). The results
are given in Fig. 1 for sample B8, for different amount of input power. Figure 2 shows the excess
heat as a function of the current density. Table 2 gives the summary of the results obtained.

The cell produced excess heat for a time period of ~33 hrs at which time the current through
the cell was stopped for ~5 min. When the current was switched on again no excess heat was
observed (West - ΔT points were again exactly on the calibration line). The cell was kept running
for five days, but the excess heat could not be re-obtained.
Figure 3 shows the calorimetric results for sample B9. There are some distinct differences
between the sample B8 and B9. Thus, in the case of B8, the excess heat was observed as soon as
the current was switched on. However, in the case of B9, as the current was increased from 0.05
A to 1 A and then back to 0.05 A, the points were very close to the calibration curve. But, in the
third cycle, the points moved distinctly above the line and stayed above it. The absolute value of
the excess heat for this sample was about half the value obtained for sample B8.
In addition to the above two samples, another Pd electrode of 0.1 cm diameter was tested in a
micro-calorimeter (in Center for Electrochemical Systems and Hydrogen Research) and observed
to produce excess heat (Fig. 4).
Thus, out of ten electrodes examined for at least 10 days for possible excess heat production,
we have observed heat production in excess of that expected from electrochemical theory in
three cases, i.e., for electrodes B8, B9 and A9.

The following tentative conclusions can be made:
1) The excess heat observed is around 5 watts cm-3 at 400 mA-cm-2. Evidence for the absence
of untoward heat production (e.g., from recombination) was given strongly by the persistent
falling of points, from many electrodes, precisely on the calibration curve of Fig. 1 (zero excess
heat). This agreement also served to verify the eq. (E-1.54)×I for the normal production of heat
from D2O electrolysis cell.

2) The absolute excess heat produced with electrodes as small as 1 cm in length and l mm in
diameter at 100 mA-cm-2 may therefore be as small as 0.04 watts - many calorimeters at present
being used would not have sufficient sensitivity.
3) The effect lasts for times of more than 30 hrs. However, it can suddenly cease and does not
recover.
There is insufficient evidence to know if there is a connection between the excess heat
observed here and the emission of neutrons and tritium observed at this University on other
(mostly 0.1 cm. diameter) electrodes [7].
