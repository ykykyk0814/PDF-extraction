METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CARRYING OUT NICKEL AND
HYDROGEN EXOTHERMAL REACTIONS
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
5
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for carrying out nickel and hydrogen
exothermal reactions, and has been stimulated by the
well known requirement of finding energy sources
10 alternative to fossil sources, to prevent atmospheric
carbon dioxide contents from being unnecessarily
increased.
For meeting the above need non polluting energy
sources should be found which do not involve health
15 risks, are economically competitive with respect to oil
sources susceptible to be easily discovered and
exploited and naturally abundant.
Many of the above alternative energy sources
have already been explored and operatively tested even
20 on an industrial scale, and comprise biomasses, solar
energy used both for heating and photovoltaic electric
generation purposes, aeolian energy, fuel materials of
vegetable or agricultural nature, geothermal and sea
wave energy and so on.
25 	 A possible alternative to natural oil, is the
uranium-fission nuclear energy. However, yet unresolved
problems affect nuclear energy such as great safety and
waste material processing problems, since, as is well
known, radioactive waste materials remain dangerously
30 active for thousands or millions of years, with
consequent great risks for persons living near
radioactive waste disposal-off places.
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
2
To the above the fact should also be added that,
at present, a, nuclear fusion based on a laser actuated
inertial confining method does not allow to make
efficient power systems.
5 	 The above drawbacks are also true for deuterium-
tritium fusion processes, as shown by the operating
times estimated for the ITER project, which should
within the year 2025 should allow to construct power
systems according to the so-called DEMO project to
10 make, within the year 2035, the first fusion power
station.
In fact, up to now, the so-called "cold" fusion,
after an early announcement by Fleischmann and Pons in
1989 (M. Fleischmann, M. Hawkins, S. Pons: Journal
15 Electroanal. Chem., 261,301-1989), notwithstanding
several exploiting attempts on a world-wise scale, has
not provided useful and reliable systems capable of
generating energy for normal, industrial or domestic
applications.
20 	 The most intelligent work performed in the
fusion field, which work has been accurately studied by
the present inventor for practicing his invention, is a
study of Prof. Sergio Focardi, (Dipartimento di Fisica
dell'UniveritA di Bologna), and Prof. Francesco
25 Piantelli, (Dipartimento di Fisica dell'UniversitA di
Siena) as disclosed in the following bibliographic

accurately studies the following related patents: US-

25 	 An analysis of the above mentioned references
shows that:
1- all experiments performed based on cold
fusion have not permitted to generate power in such an
amount to be reliably and constantly exploited in
30 industrial applications;
2- all the uranium based methods and systems
have not up to now solved the problem of safely
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
4
disposing of nuclear waste materials;
3- all the nuclear fusion based methods and
systems have not been shown as capable of generating
significative amounts of energy while allowing the
5 . . fusion process to be safely monitored;
4- all the magnetic and inertial confining based
methods and systems, such as the plasma fusion method,
cannot be properly economically managed; and
5- the catalyzed fusion of negative muons based
10 methods and systems cannot be used because of the muon
short life.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
15 	 Accordingly, the aim of the present invention is
to provide a method allowing to produce energy in an
economic, convenient, reliable and repetitive manner,
without generating radiations and radioactive waste
materials.
20 	 Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, a
main object of the invention is to provide such a
method which can be carried out in small size systems,
adapted to be easily controlled and allowing to heat
individual places at an operating cost less than that
25 of commercially available heating systems.
According to one aspect of the present
invention, the above mentioned aim and objects, as well
as yet other objects, which will become more apparent
hereinafter, are achieved by a method and apparatus for
30 carrying out a highly efficient exothermal reaction
between nickel atoms and hydrogen atoms, in a tube,
preferably, though not exclusively made of a metal,
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/IT2008/000532
5
filled by a nickel powder and heated to a high
temperature preferably, though not necessarily, from
150 to 500 ° C, by injecting hydrogen into said metal
tube said nickel powder being pressurized, preferably,
5 though not necessarily, to a pressure from 2 to 20
bars.
In applicant exothermal reaction the hydrogen
nuclei, due to a high absorbing capability of nickel
therefor, are compressed about the metal atom nuclei,
10 while said high temperature generates internuclear
percussions which are made stronger by the catalytic
action of optional elements, thereby triggering a
capture of a proton by the nickel powder, with a
consequent transformation of nickel to copper and a
15 beta+ decay of the latter to a nickel nucleus having a
mass which is by an unit larger than that of the
starting nickel.
The present inventor believes that in this
reaction is possibly involved a capture of a proton by
20 a nickel nucleus which is transformed into a copper
nucleus with a consequent beta decay of the formed
unstable copper (Cu 59 - 64) since the produced thermal
energy is larger, as it will be thereinafter
demonstrated, than the energy introduced by the
25 electric resistance.
It is believed that the nickel nuclei are
transformed to copper since the mass (energy) of the
final status (copper isotope) is less than the overall
mass (energy) of the starting status (nickel isotope +
30 	proton).
The exothermal reaction thereon Applicant's
invention is based differs from those adopted by prior
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
6
searchers since the inventor has not tried to
demonstrate .an emission of elementary particles
supporting a validity of a theory, but he has
exclusively tried to provide an amount of energy larger
5 than the consumed energy amount, to just achieve a
practical method and apparatus for generating an energy
amount larger than the consumed energy, and this by
exploiting nuclear energy generating processes starting
from electrochemical energy.
10 	 Thus, 	the 	inventive 	apparatus 	has 	been
specifically designed for producing the above mentioned
energy in a reliable, easily controllable, safe,
repeatable manner, for any desired applications.
In particular, the inventive apparatus is coated
15 by boron layers and lead plates both for restraining
noxious radiations and transforming them into energy,
without generating residue radiations and radioactive
materials.
In this connection it is pointed out that all
20 prior attempts to generate like types of energy, have
brought to small energy amounts generating prototypes
not suitable for a safe industrial use, because of the
theoretical nature of the performed searches.
25

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Thus, the aim of the present invention is to
provide an energy generating apparatus adapted to
operate in a reliable and repeatable manner and
30 including 	a 	plurality of 	series 	and parallel
connectable apparatus modules, thereby generating an
impressively high energy amount by so bombarding a
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
7
nickel atom by a hydrogen atom, to provide a large
atomic mass loss copper atom to be transformed into
energy, based on the Einstein's equation, plus a beta
decay energy of the radioactive copper atoms.
5 	 The following discussion may be considered as
valid for some (radioactive) Cu isotopes, but not for
the two stable copper isotopes (^63Cu and ^65Cu) which
do not decay.
As the copper atom decays, an energy emitting
10 positive beta decay occurs, according to the following
equations:
P = N+ e+ + v,
where
P = proton
15 	 N = neutron
E+ = positron
v = neutrino
The positron forms the electron antiparticle,
and hence, as positrons impact against the nickel
20 electrons, the electron-positron pairs are annihilated,
thereby generating a huge amount of energy.
In fact, few grams of Ni and H would produce an
energy amount equivalent to that of thousands oil tons,
as it will become more apparent hereinafter, without
25 pollutions, greenhouse effects, or carbon dioxide
increases, nuclear and other waste materials, since the
radioactive copper isotopes produced in the process
will decay to stable nickel isotopes by beta +
processes, in a very short time.
30 	 For clearly understanding the following detailed
discussion of the apparatus, it is necessary to at
first consider that for allowing nickel to be
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
8
transformed into stable copper, it is necessary to
respect 	the 	quantic 	laws. 	Accordingly, 	it 	is
indispensable to use, for the above mentioned
exothermal reactions, a nickel isotope having a mass
5 number of 62, to allow it to transform into a stable
copper isotope 62. All the other Ni isotopes, on the
other hand, will generate unstable Cu, and,
accordingly, a beta decay.
Considering that about 10 6 tons nickel for year
10 are produced through the world and since, as it will be
disclosed hereinafter in Table 1, 1 g nickel would
generate an energy amount equivalent to that produced
by 517 tons oil, thus the yearly produced nickel
amount, assuming that only 1/10,000 generates nuclear
15 processes, will provide
1,000,000,000,000*517/10000 	= 	51,700,000,000 	(oil
equivalent) ton per year.
And this without considering the fact that the
yearly nickel production could be easily increased,
20 depending on demand, and that, like mineral oil, nickel
can be recovered and remelted from nickel scraps of
steelwork and electronic applications.
Actually, nickel is one of the most abundant
metals of the Earth crust.

Further characteristics and advantages of the
present invention will become more apparent hereinafter
30 from the following detailed disclosure of a preferred,

limitative, example, in the accompanying drawings,
where:
Figure 1 is a constructional diagram of the
apparatus according to the present invention;
5 	 Figure 2 is a picture, taken by a 1.400 x
electronic microscope, showing the nickel powder (on a
1.400 x scale), withdrawn by the apparatus;
Figures 3 and 4 are electronic microscope
diagrams related to the powder atomic composition, at
10 the two points shown by the arrows in figure 2.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
With reference to the number references of the
15 above mentioned figures, the apparatus according to the
present invention comprises an electric resistance 1,
enclosed in a metal tube 2, further including therein a
nickel powder 3.
A solenoid valve 4 adjusts the pressure under
20 	hydrogen 5 is introduced into the metal tube.
Both the temperature generated by the electric
resistance or resistor and the hydrogen injection
pressure can be easily adjusted either to constant or
pulsating values.
25 	 More specifically, the electric resistance, or
other heat source, is switched off as the exothermal
reaction generating energizing status is triggered. A
thermostat will hold said heat source operating,
depending on the temperature in the circuit.
30 	 The assembly comprising said electric resistance
and nickel holding copper tube is shielded from the
outer environment by using, respectively from the
which
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/IT2008/000532
10
inside to the outside:
a) a jacket 7 including water and boron, or only
boron
b) a further lead jacket 8, which, optionally,
though not necessarily, may be coated by a steel layer
9.
The above mentioned coatings are so designed as
to restrain all radiations emitted by the exothermal
reaction and transform said radiation into thermal
10 energy.
The heat generated by the particle decay and
nuclear transformations will heat the primary fluid,
comprising borated water, thereby said primary fluid,
in turn, will exchange heat with the secondary circuit,
15 in turn heated by said primary fluid and conveying the
produced thermal energy to desired applications, such
as electric power, heating, mechanical energy, and so
on.
In the absence of a primary fluid, the fluid to
20 be heated will exchange heat directly with the lead and
steel jacket.
According to a further embodiment of the
invention, the apparatus further comprises the
following features.
25 	 Nickel is coated in a copper tube 100, including
a heating electric resistance 101, adjusted and
controlled by a controlling thermostat (not shown)
adapted to switch off said resistance 101 as nickel is
activated by hydrogen contained in a bottle 107.
30  A first steel-boron armored construction 102,
coated by a second lead armored construction 103,
protect both the copper tube, the hydrogen bottle
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
1 1
connection assembly 106, and the hydrogen bottle or
cylinder 107, thereby restraining radiations through
the overall radiation life, allowing said radiations to
be transformed into thermal energy.
5 	 On the outside of the lead armored construction,
the copper reactor cooling water, circulates through a
steel outer pipe assembly 105, and this conveyed to
thermal energy using devices.
The above disclosed prototype can also be used
10 as a heating module which, in a series and/or parallel
coupling relationship with other like modules, will
provide a basic core desired size and power heating
systems.
A practical embodiment of the inventive
15 apparatus, installed on October 16, 2007, is at present
perfectly operating 24 hours per day, and provides an
amount of heat sufficient to heat the factory of the
Company EON of via Carlo Ragazzi 18, at Bondeno
(Province of Ferrara).
20 	 For better understanding the invention, the main
components of the above mentioned apparatus have been
schematically shown in Table 2.
The above mentioned apparatus, which has not
been yet publicly disclosed, has demonstrated that, for
25 a proper operation, the hydrogen injection must be
carried out under a variable pressure.
The electric resistance temperature controlling
thermostat has been designed to switch off said
electric resistance after 3-4 hours of operation,
. 30 thereby providing self-supplied system, continuously
emitting thermal energy in an amount larger than that
initially generated by said electric resistance, which
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
12
mode of operation is actually achieved by an exothermal
reaction.
As it will be shown in a detailed manner in the
following Table 1, it is possible to calculate that,
5 supposing a full transformation, a mole, that is 58 g
nickel, generate the same amount of energy obtained by
burning about 30,000 tons of oil.
Figures 2-5 show data measured on January 30,
2008 which basically demonstrate that the invention
10 actually provides a true nuclear cold fusion.
The photo of figure 2 ,( obtained by a 1.400 x
electronic microscope) shows the nickel powder on a
1.400 x scale, as withdrawn from the apparatus: in
particular said photo clearly shows the flake granules,
15 greatly promoting an absorption of the hydrogen atoms
by the nickel nuclei.
The two arrows in the figure show the two
positions of the powder sample thereon the electronic
microscope tests for detecting the powder atomic
20 composition have been carried out.
The two graphs of figures 3 and 4 have been made
by the electronic microscope of Dipartimento di Fisica
dell'Universitd di Bologna, under the supervision of
Prof. Sergio Focardi, on January 30, 2008, and are
25 related to the powder atomic composition at the two
above points of figure 2
In particular, said graphs clearly show that
zinc is formed, whereas zinc was not present in the
nickel powder originally loaded into the apparatus said
30 zinc being actually generated by a fusion of a nickel
atom and two hydrogen atoms.
This demonstrates that, in addition to fusion,
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/IT2008/000532
13
the inventive reaction also provides a nickel nucleus
fission phenomenon generating lighter stable atoms.
Moreover, it has been found that, after having
generated energy the used powders contained both copper
5 and lighter than nickel atoms (such as sulphur,
chlorine, potassium, calcium).
This demonstrate that, in addition to fusion,
also a nickel nucleus fission phenomenon generating
lighter stable atoms occurs.
10 	 It has been found that the invention fully .
achieves the intended aim and objects.
TABLE 1
15 	 Determining the energy produced by a nickel mol.
1 nickel mol = 58 g
Avogadro number 6.022 x 10 23 mol-1 = number of
nickel atoms in 58 g nickel.
The energy generated in each hydrogen capture
20 process has been evaluated (for each nickel isotope)
from the difference between the initial mass (nickel +
hydrogen) and the reaction end product mass.
A reasonable estimate, considering the different
values for the different isotopes, is 10 MeV electron
25. (a MeV corresponds to a million electron-volts and is
the energy measuring unit, as conventionally used in
nuclear physics).
Since 1 Mev is equivalent to a variation of mass
of 1.78 x 10 -30 kg, the mass variation corresponding to
30 an energy emission of 10 Mev is 1.78 x 10 -29 kg.
The mass loss corresponding to a transformation
of an entire Ni mol can be calculated by multiplying
WO 2009/125444 	 PCT/1T2008/000532
14
the Avogadro number (6.022 x 1023 ) time the mass
variation of the single reaction.
Thus is obtained (for 58 g Ni)
M=(6.022 x 10 23 ) x 1.7 .8 x 10 -29 kg=1.07 x 10-5 kg
5 	 From the Einstein equation we have
E = mc2 where c is the light speed c = 3 x 10 8
m/s.
Thus, by replacing:
J=1.07 x 10 -5 x (3 x 10 8 ) 2 = 9.63 x 10 11 J which
10 can be approximated to 0.3 x 10 9 kcal (which can be
approximated by defect to reserve).
This is an energy equivalent to about 30,000 ton
oil considering a pci of 10,000 kcal/kg for mineral
oil; thus, 58 g nickel will generate the same energy as
15 that provided by 30,000 ton oil, that is 517 tons/gram.
