“ Energy is really the key to Space
Travel”
Outline
• What
• Status
• Why
• Plans
LENR [Low Energy Nuclear
Reactions] Precis
• Originally dubbed “Cold Fusion”, an experimental
discovery with replication issues and no
acceptable theory
• Now, over 2 decades of world-wide data
collection/experiments indicate is “real”
• Now, a Weak Interaction Theories [
Widom/Larsen, etc.]
• Not “Hot Fusion”,  electroweak interactions
explicable via the “Standard Model” of Quantum
Theory on Surfaces
• Theory being used to increase heat “quality” and
practicality, Minimal radiation safety issues
A Conjectured LENR PROCESS
• Load H2 onto a metal surface, Plasmons
initiate collective effects
• Add  energy, produce high voltage gradients at
cracks/ asperities
• Gradients excite electrons, via collective
effects [ QED] to combine with protons to
form an ultra low momentum neutron, never
leaves the surface
• Neutron readily absorbed, neutron rich
isotope undergoes beta decay , emits heat
“Preliminaries”
• IS IT REAL? - Over 2 decades with over 100 experiments
worldwide indicate LENR is real, much greater than
Chemical, Transmutations, Minimal radiation
• WHAT IS IT? – Theories  indicate is weak interactions/
beta decay, NOT “Fusion”
• IS IT USEFUL? – There are several experimental claims
of  “useful” quantities of heat, thus far in the watts-to-
KWs range
Current LENR SOA
• Most of the 2 decades of experiments, lacking theoretical
guidance, produced low levels of energy. Most used the P-F
D/Pd electrochemical cells
• Zawodny et ot LaRC  utilized theory to attempt to increase
energy output, under experimental investigation
• From the world wide experiments a huge number of “knobs”/
approaches appear to “work”, issue is how good can it be?
Requires experiments guided by theory and major “creative”
efforts/ inputs along with CAREFUL Experiments,
Summary of Evidence in Expts. For
Weak Interaction/ Nuclear Effects
• He4 produced
• Transmutations, which/what dependant upon
experiment details
• Energy produced at levels beyond chemical
•  Little worrisome radiation, no dead graduate
students, No way to overcome Coulomb
Barrier via strong force physics
Summary of Evidence for Weak Force
• Metal hydrides of both H & D
• High H loading required
• Not just 4He being produced
•  Range of elemental transmutations
• Energy input needed
• Forcing at resonant hydride frequencies
is effective
• Only Sporadic detection of neutron or
gamma radiation
WLT Predictions
• Reaction rate is related to the SPP amplitudes at the
proton resonant frequency

• Reactions are sporadic on smooth or randomly
patterned devices driven by broadband SPPs

• Reaction rate should increase when driven at the
proper frequency (e.g., multi-wavelength lasers)

• Reaction rate should increase for patterned / resonant
devices (focus of ongoing LaRC experiments)
Benefits of LENR Technology
• LENR may solve Global Climate and Energy…..
• A 10KW device would solve oil issues, power
transportation, provide distributed generation for
homes, some industrial applications, desalinate
water
• Theory indicates scales from PDAs to GW Power
plants, could possibly replace petroleum, natural gas
and coal, as well as Fission Nuclear. Possibly less
expensive than “conventional “Renewables”
LENR Technology could also
possibly clean up radioactive waste
via transmutation as well as
produce elements in short supply [
e.g. rare earths].
Overall – Vast impacts upon
Climate, Econometrics, National
Security and Quality of Life
NASA Interest[s] in LENR

•  Direct and potentially massively/ truly “game-
changing” Applications across the board to
NASA Mission Areas:
- Science
- Exploration
- Aeronautics
NASA Science LENR Applications
• Superb light weight power/ energy sources for
space probes/ instruments and hoppers/ rovers,
far less expensive than solar and better than
radiologics for beyond Mars where solar does not
“work”
• Reduced LEO and in space propulsion weights/
costs
•  Solves EDL for large payloads to Mars via
ingestion, heating and retro injection of
atmospheric CO2
NASA Exploration LENR Applications
• Preliminary systems studies indicate LEO access rockets
with Nuc Thermal Isp [ ~ 800 Seconds] sans the Nuc
radiation protection weights/ safety issues
• On Planet Nuc power/ Energy without usual Nuc
Radiation protection/ safety issues
•  Potentially obviates order of 80% of the 1000 metric
ton LEO up-mass for Humans Mars which is in-space
fuel, Propulsive mass from far outer region atmosphere
or regolith
•  Source for energy beaming, energy to terraform Mars,
Enables  Active Space Radiation Protection

This technology produces
transmutations, i.e. could be used
for ISRU to produce/ provide
requisite materials/ elements not
otherwise available
NASA Aeronautical LENR Applications
• Overall, enables what we have never had  -
“Energy Rich” design space[s]
• Fuel fraction could become negligible, huge
impacts upon vehicle gross weights, especially
for SST’s which are some 55% fuel fraction
• Use to replace combustors in GTE’s or via
Sterling or T-E’s to generate electricity for
electric propulsors
Aeronautical Applications Continued
• Huge range increases
• Enables VTOL and PAVE both economical and
QUIET
• Enables design for ultra low noise via
degrading propulsor performance
• Mitigates sonic boom via focused energy
projected far forward to reduce shock
strength, “lengthen” vehicle virtually
Aeronautical Applications Continued
• Makes SST’s affordable via huge gross weight
reductions, reduces sonic boom, enables
emission compliance
• “Solves” emissions except for NOx, which can
be mitigated via “design” or obviated if go
electric
• Enables huge loiter capability for “sensor
craft” [ military, climate/ science, law
enforcement, HALE Sat substitutes, etc.
Aeronautical Applications Continued
• Reduces both acquisition and operational
costs
• Enables envelope-less flight via active flow
control, “Bird Like Flight”, ALL-WEATHER
• Provides huge margins to enable superb safety
[ Armored engine surrounds, triply redundant
Faraday caged Electronics, Etc..]
Aeronautical Applications Continued
• Allows direct control of wake vortices to obviate
wake vortex hazard
• Super STOL performance via circulation/ flow
control to increase runway productivity by a
factor of 3
•  Overall, For Aero – far lower gross weights,
higher speeds, lower noise, greater range,
emissions solved, envelope-less/all weather
superb ride quality flight, lower costs, greater
safety
Aeronautical Applications Continued
• Possibly obviates THE issue with hypervelocity
air-breathing, the decreasing value-added
from burning H2 fuel as a function of
increasing vehicle kinetic energy

In Short, LENR , depending upon the TBD
performance, appears to be capable of
Revolutionizing Aerospace across the
board. No other single technology even
comes close to the potential impacts of
LENR upon Agency Missions.
Comments on LENR Going Forward
• Test/ determine the performance of the extant devices
• Experimentally validate the weak interaction theories
• Utilize theory to design/ create and experimentally
optimize performance, including surface morphology
considerations/ opportunities and bootstrapping
• Summarize the myriad approaches throughout the
entire system/ sequence that appear to work [ e.g. the
several methods of adding energy].

Comments Continued……
• The 2 decades of experiments and the weak
interaction theories have removed the existential
risk, what is remaining is to ENGINEER for
improved performance. Also obviously all the
safety issues, labs have blown up studying this
arena
• SO – We need to Invent/ create optimized/
improved, SAFE LENR “Devices”

WHY has it taken some 22 years?
• Is apparently/ possibly a non-obvious
engineered PROCESS exploiting  The Weak
Force
• Initial claims of “cold Fusion” Seriously
“Poisoned the well”, became the Energetics
UFO, 3rd Rail
• Required nearly 2 decades of experiments
AND the Weak Interaction Theory to convince
some folks [ e.g. LaRC] to study this
WHY - continued
• Claims of cold fusion, lack of Physics
understanding and low energy production
levels held this up

WHY 22 Years - Summary
• Initially little understanding, replication issues,
low heat production, cold fusion red herring –
few were interested
• 22 years of expts. provide an existence proof
• Weak INTERACTION theories provides an
“understanding”
• Now an EXTREME requirement for inexpensive
clean energy and a NASA “affordability”
problem
Utilization Approaches
• LENR produces Heat, Depending upon design
potentially from the theory a great deal of heat
•  Can utilize the Heat directly as in open
propulsion systems etc. or via such as Sterling
cycles, Thermoelectrics, Pyroelectrics, T-PV etc.
convert the heat into electricity
•  High power density may be possible with
minimal radiation issues/ problems/ weights and
inexpensive fuels/ systems.
We went directly from Chemical to strong
force Nuc and in the process bought huge
energetics improvements and radiation
protection/ safety issues that precluded
many fission nuc application[s], We leapt
over the weak interaction energetics
landscape except for radiologics. We are
back-tracking…….

This  appears to be one of those massively
game-changing Techs that appear once a
generation or less. We will spend the next
20 years understanding and
ideating/optimizing Weak Force
Engineering, a blank page [ except for
some existing Edisonian devices] to be
written on.
Physics Outlook/Issues
• Quantum and Relativity do not “Merge”
• They do not explain “Dark Energy”[  ` 73%  of the
Universe]
• They do not explain “Dark Matter”[ 23% of the
Universe]
• They do not provide an “understanding” of “Non-
Locality”
• Where did the Anti-Matter Go?……
• 100 plus orders of magnitude difference[s] wrt
ZPE between Quantum theory and the operable
Cosmological Constant
• Many other “Unsolved Problems”/Anomalies…..
Extant “Explanation” Approaches
[Samples,Additional Degrees of Freedom,
Experimental Verification TBD..]
• Time Reversals/Retrocausation”
• Extra [Spatial] Dimensions
- Many Worlds/Multiverses
- String/M/Brane Theories [ to 11 Dim.]
- 5 Dim. Larger Universe/ “The Bulk”
• “Larger Constructs”
- Bohm Quantum Potential
- Holographic Universe
- Puthoff ZPAether, Winterberg Planck Aether
• Non-Linear Quantum Theory

Quantum Sitrep……..
• MAGNIFICANT Theory accurate in some cases
to 16 to 26 decimal places
• Applications largely based upon “shut up and
compute” and FAPP [ For all practical
purposes]
• No quantum gravity [ yet..]
• Quantum Ontology a cottage industry “work
in progress”
• “Meaning” of entanglement still “elusive”
What is Sought are “Explanations”  for
Dark Matter/Energy and Non-Locality
Etc.  which satisfy Occam’s Razor &
Experimentally verified.
Once Found/Determined the
Ensuing/Enabled Technologies should
be Seriously Revolutionary, including
wrt Energy, Stay Tuned…….[ ZPE,
Gravity Control, Warps/ Worms,
Teleportation?]
