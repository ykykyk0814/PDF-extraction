ABSTRACT

Additional resistances contributed to that of PdHx electrode in an electrolyte using the direct current method
are calculated. It is found that an electrode with a large ratio of length to radius, an active surface, a surrounding
electrolyte with high conductance and high electrolysis current will induce substantial additional resistances.


1. INTRODUCTION

It has long been recognized that the electrical resistance of PdHx (taken to include PdDx, as below) is a
function of x. This relationship has been used to infer the loading ratio in the electrolysis experiments.[1−8]
However, the in-situ resistance measurement (ISRM) has inherent defects, e.g. the non-uniform distribution of H
concentration, temperature, electrolyte and applied currents all influence the measured value. In this paper, we
will discuss the electrochemical effects on the ISRM in the direct current (dc) situation.

2. MODEL AND RESULTS

The electrochemical factors affect the ISRM in three aspects. First, the solution acts as a resistance in
parallel with the electrode and the apparent PdHx resistance decreases when co-conduction is in progress. Second,
the potential drop across the electrode induced by the measuring dc makes it behaves as a concentration-cell,
which contributes an additional potential shift to the signal measured. Thirdly, the electrolysis current (ec)
contributes another potential drop to the electrode by the current collection into the electrode and the
concentration-cell effect. We will theoretically study these problems in turn.

2.1. Co-conduction of electrolyte

Consider a straight rod electrode with length l and radius r, the solution resistance can be seen as the series
resistance of two hemispheres with radius r: RS = ρSl/πr, where ρS is the resistivity of solution. The additional
resistance contributed to that of PdHx electrode by the co-conduction of solution, RA,S can be expressed as:

where R and ρ is the resistance and resistivity of PdHx, respectively.

2.2. Concentration-cell effect of measurement current

Consider a measurement current IM passing through an electrode, the electromotive force (emf) of the
concentration-cell is the potential drop IMR. It can be expressed as EC = IMR(1/2 − z/l), where the fraction 1/2 in
the parentheses ensures the average potential to be zero. The overall emf is comprised of the ohm potential drop
of external circuit ∆EPdHx,C, ohm polarization of inner resistance ∆ES,C and electrochemical overpotential ηC. The
potential drop across the small distance dz at point z in PdHx electrode is dEPdHx,C = −ICRdz/l. The electrolyte
resistance in the small distance dz can be seen as the resistance of a part of the cylindrical electrode with radius r
and surface area 2πrdz in the solution: ∆ES,C = (ρ/2π)ln[(l/r)dIC/dz]. The overpotential of the concentration-cell
can be obtained by the differential of electrolysis current density (ecd) jE with respect to the electrolysis
overpotential η: jC = fj0CηC with the current density of the concentration-cell jC = dIC/2πr0dz, f = F/RT and j0C =
max(j0V, β|jE|), where j0V is the exchange current density of the Volmer reaction; β is the stoichiometric number
of the hydrogen electrode reaction.[9]

2.3. Effect of electrolysis current.

In the ISRM of electrode during electrolysis process, the ec that is collected in the electrode will contribute a
potential drop to the measuring signal because the electrode has a resistance. As a primary approximation,
supposing the ec (IE) uniform distributes on the electrode. From a small distance dz at point z, we obtain the
relationship between the increment of current in the electrode and jE: dIE = 2πrjEdz, where jE is connected with IE
by jE = IE/2πrl. The potential drop across the small distance dz is dEE = −IERdz/l. Combining these two equations
and integration dEE with respect to z, we obtain the potential at a point z caused by the electrolysis current
collection is EE = IER(1/3 − z2/l2), where the fraction 1/3 in the parentheses ensures the average potential to be
zero. The potential drop across the electrode is ∆EE = IER/2. This means that the electrode behaves as that with a
half value of the original resistance.
The ec also has a concentration-cell effect. Similar to Eq. (3), we have:

The solution is IC = [sin(kz/l)/sink − z/l]IE. The potential shift contributed to the external circuit is ∆EPdHx,C =
h(k)IER/2. The corresponding additional resistance contributed to the measurement value is the sum of these
caused by the electrolysis current collection and its concentration-cell effect:

It must be pointed out that ∆EE appears instantly while ec is applied; whereas ∆EPdHx,C delays by a time
interval which depends on the electrode diameter and surface properties.[2]

From this equation, we find that the three measurement errors with different origins can be incorporated to a
more uniform expression. On the whole, four dimensionless quantities, i.e. IE/IM, l/r, ρ/ρS and rfρSj0C determine
Rappa as shown in the Figure.
First, it is found that the contribution of electrolysis process to the ISRM depends on the direction and
magnitude of ec as shown in Fig. (a). If IE/IM > 0, it will contribute to the measured resistance a positive shift.
Otherwise, it will diminish the magnitude of the measured value while IE/IM < 0. This is the reason of delta-mode
current being used to cannel out the electrolysis contribution in experiments. [3,4]
On the other hand, Rappa increases with l/r as shown in Fig. (b). It means the length and diameter have
430
prominent influences on the resistance measurement. This is one of reasons of great value of Rappa observed by
Carson et al.[2] although they have not predicted it.

Figure. Rappa as functions of (a) IE/IM (b) l/r and (c) rfρSj0C. The parameters not emphasized are l/r = 500, IE/IM = 0, rfρSj0C =
0.1 except cited in each figure.
Figure (c) shows dependences of Rappa on rfρSj0C. It indicates that the electrode diameter, temperature,
electrolyte conductance, electrode roughness and exchange current density of electrode reaction all affect Rappa.
An electrode with rough surface results in a large value of j0V, hence large values of j0C. At the same time, some
additives such as H2S and thiourea can inhibit the reaction rate of Pd|H electrode, so it is easy to understand that
they can diminish Rappa as observed experimentally.[2] Another factor is the ecd, a large magnitude of ecd results in
great values of j0C and RA,M as the effect of j0V.
Figure also shows that the resistivity ratio ρ/ρS has the most important effect. If ρ/ρS < 10-6, it has only little
influence on Rappa, otherwise, the additional resistance may not be neglected.
Finally, It must be pointed out that the concentration-cell effect appears only in the single phase PdHx
electrode. In the mixed α+β phase, the H chemical potential does not change in PdHx under the external potential
drop[2] and h(k) = 0. Even in this case, the electrolysis current collection and electrolyte co-conduction still have
contribution to the ISRM, so a low value of IE/IM is the necessary condition in the dc method.
Results here are mainly theoretically, their qualitatively aspects are consistent with available experiments.
[1,2,4] The quantitative verifications need to be carried out in future experimental works.
