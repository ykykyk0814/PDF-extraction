Abstract
A consistent conventional theoretical description is presented for anomalous low-
energy deuterium nuclear fusion in micro/nano-scale metal grains and particles.
The theory is based on the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state occupied by
deuterons trapped in a micro/nano-scale metal grain or particle. The theory is
capable of explaining most of the experimentally observed results and also
provides theoretical predictions. Experimental tests of theoretical predictions are
proposed. Scalabilities of the observed effects are discussed based on theoretical
predictions.

1. Introduction
The conventional deuterium fusion in free space proceeds via the following nuclear reactions:
{1} D+D→p(3.02 MeV) + T (1.01 MeV);
{2} D+D→n(2.45 MeV)+3He(0.82 MeV); and
{3} D+D→4He+γ(23.8 MeV).
The cross-sections (or reaction rates) for reactions {1} – {3} have been measured by beam
experiments at intermediate energies ( ≥10 keV), and are expected to be extremely small at low
energies (≤ 10 eV) due to the Gamow factor arising from Coulomb barrier between two
deuterons. The measured cross-sections have branching ratios: (σ{1}, σ{2}, σ{3}) ≈ (1, 1, 10-6).
From many experimental measurements by Fleischmann and Pons in 1989, and many others
over 19 years since then [1], including the recent work by Szpak, Mosier-Boss, and Gordon [2]
and the most recent work by Arata and Zhang [3], the following fact has been established. At
ambient temperatures or low energies (≤ 10 eV), deuterium fusion in metal proceeds via the
following reactions:
{4}D(m) + D(m)→p(m) + T(m) + 4.03 MeV (m);
{5} D(m) + D(m)→n(m) + 3He(m) + 3.27 MeV (m); and
{6} D(m) + D(m)→4He(m) + 23.8 MeV (m),
where m represents a host metal lattice or metal particle. Reaction rate R for {6} is dominant
over reaction rates for {4} and {5}, i.e., R{6} >> R{4} and R{6} >> R{5}. Additional
experimental observations include requirements of both higher deuteron loading (D/Pd ≥1) and
deuterium purity (H/D << 1), the phenomenon of “heat after death”, and enhancement of the
2
effect by electromagnetic fields and laser stimulation. In this paper, a consistent conventional
theoretical description is presented for explaining the above observations of deuterium nuclear
fusion in micro/nano-scale metal grains and particles. The theory presented in this paper is
capable of explaining the above observations, and provides theoretical predictions which can be
tested experimentally for the confirmation of the theory.
In the following, a detailed description of the theoretical explanation, based on the theory of
Bose-Einstein condensation nuclear fusion (BECNF) [4-7] and on selection rules recently
derived for a mixed system of two species [8], will be presented along with suggested
experimental tests of predictions of the theory and a discussion of the scalability of the fusion
rates based on the theory.
2. Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensation Nuclear Fusion (BECNF)
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism: The concept of the Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) [9] has been known for 84 years (since 1924), and has been used to describe
all physical scales, including liquid 4He, excitons in semiconductors, pions and kaons in dense
nuclear matter (neutron stars, supernovae), and elementary particles [10]. It is only 13 years ago
in 1995 that the BEC phenomenon was observed directly in dilute vapors of alkali atoms, such as
rubidium [11], lithium [12], and sodium [13] confined in magnetic traps and cooled down to
nano Kelvin temperatures.
In the atomic BEC case [11], the BEC state was created by cooling dilute Rb atoms loaded into
a magnetic confinement potential at 300 K. It was cooled by laser cooling (Doppler cooling) to
~ 90 μK (4 x 106 atoms) with a density of 2 x 1010 atoms/cm3. Further cooling was
accomplished by evaporation cooling removing energetic atoms to 170 nK. At 170nK, it consists
of 2000 atoms at a number density of 2.6 x 1012/cm3 in BEC state (near zero velocity) while
other 2 x 104 atoms in the trap had a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution with a
exponential tail characteristic of T ≈ 170nK.  The requirement for BEC, λdb > d, is satisfied,
where λdb is the de Broglie wavelength and d is interatomic spacing distance.
In our nuclear BEC phenomenon, we have deuteron number density of ~ 6.8 x 1022cm-3 in
metal, corresponding to an average separation distance of d ≈ 2.45 Å between deuterons.  In
order to achieve the nuclear BEC state of deuterons in metal, we need to have the average
deuteron kinetic energy Td smaller than c
dT = 0.0063 eV, i.e. Td < c
dT , in order to satisfy the
requirement λdb > d.
The MB distribution is originally derived for weakly interacting dilute gas (ideal gas). For
strongly interacting and dense systems such as mobile deuterons in metal, the MB distribution is
not applicable and hence average deuteron kinetic energy of kT = 0.026 eV at T = 300 K is not
applicable for deuterons in metal.
Mobility of deuterons in a metal is a complex phenomenon and may involve a number of
different processes [14]: coherent tunneling, incoherent hopping, phonon-assisted processes,
thermally activated tunneling, and over-barrier jump/fluid like motion at higher temperatures. If
mobile deuterons in a metal are confined by a confining potential provided by metal atoms and
electrons, it may be possible that deuteron momentum or velocity distribution in a metal may
have the average deuteron kinetic energy smaller than c
d
T = 0.0063 eV, thus satisfying λdb > d.
We note that c
d
T = 0.0063 eV corresponds to the average deuteron velocity of vc = 0.78 x 105
3
cm/sec while the average deuteron kinetic energy of kT = 0.026 eV with T = 300 K corresponds
to the average deuteron velocity of vk = 1.6 x 105 cm/sec. Boundaries for micro/nano-scale metal
grains and particles can act as barriers and may slow down mobile deuterons resulting in lower
average velocity v < vc and smaller average kinetic energy Td < c
dT near boundaries. Therefore,
it may be possible that the conditions, Td < c
dT and λdb > d, are achieved for mobile deuterons in
localized regions of the metal without cooling as done in the atomic BEC case, and hence, it may
be possible to observe experimentally the effects of the nuclear BEC.
Mobility of proton and deuteron in metals: It is well know that the hydrogen ions are highly
mobile within metal hydrides [14,15]. Hydrogen mobility takes various temperature dependent
forms. The mobility extends to “fluid like” motion at temperatures comparable to the interstitial
site or self-trapping, binding energy ~ 0.15 eV. At higher temperatures below the melting point,
hydrogen ions no longer remain within the potential wells of interstitial sites but undergo free
motion similar to the motion of atoms in gases [14]. It is expected that the mobility of hydrogen
ions (or deuterium ions) will increase, as the loading ratio H/metal (or D/metal) of hydrogen
atoms (or deuterium atoms) increases and becomes larger than one, H/metal ≥ 1 (or D/metal ≥ 1).
Theoretical formulation for single species case: For applying the concept of the BEC
mechanism to deuterium fusion in a nano-scale metal particle, we consider N identical charged
Bose nuclei (deuterons) confined in an ion trap (or a metal grain or particle). Some fraction of
trapped deuterons are assumed to be mobile as discussed above. For simplicity, we assume an
isotropic harmonic potential for the ion trap to obtain order of magnitude estimates of fusion
reaction rates. N-body Schroedinger equation for the system is given by

for obtaining the approximate the ground state solution for Eq. (1) and the approximate
theoretical formula for the deuteron-deuteron fusion rate in an ion trap (nano-scale metal
particle). The use of an alternative method based on the mean-field theory for bosons (see
Appendix in [6]) yields the same result.

Two species case and selection rule: We consider a mixture of two different species of
positively charged nuclear particles, labeled 1 and 2, with N1 and N2 particles, respectively, both
trapped in a micro/nano-scale metal grain or particle. We denote charges and masses as Z1≥ 0,
Z2≥ 0, and m1, m2, respectively. We use the mean-field theory [7,17] for a system of interacting
bosons confined in a harmonic potential to derive the following selection rule:

The detailed derivations are given in reference [8]. We now apply the selection rule, Eq. (7). If
we use m as mass number approximately given in units of the nucleon mass, we have [Z1 (D)/m1
(D)] = ½, [Z2 (p)/m2 (p)] = 1, [Z2(T)/m2 (T)] = 1/3, [Z2 (n)/m2 (n)] = 0, and [Z2(
3He)/m2 (3He)] =
2/3.
Since [Z1/m1] ≠ [Z2/m2] for reactions {4} and {5} they are forbidden or suppressed, and fusion
reaction rates for reactions {4 and {5} are expected to be small, while reaction {6} is allowed
since [Z1/m1] = [Z2/m2], and fusion reaction rate is expected to be large for reaction {6}. In
summary, we obtain R{6} >> R{4} and R{6} >> R{5}.
3. Theoretical Implications and Predictions
Eqs. (3) and (6) provide an important result that nuclear fusion rates Rtrap and Rt do not
depend on the Gamow factor in contrast to the conventional theory for nuclear fusion in free
space. This could provide explanations for overcoming the Coulomb barrier and for the claimed
anomalous effects for low-energy nuclear reactions in metals.
This is consistent with the conjecture noted by Dirac [18] and used by Bogolubov [19] that
boson creation and annihilation operators can be treated simply as numbers when the ground
state occupation number is large. This implies that for large N each charged boson behaves as an
independent particle in a common average background potential and the Coulomb interaction
between two charged bosons is suppressed.
For a single trap (or metal particle) containing N deuterons, the deuteron-deuteron fusion can
proceed with the following three reaction channels.

where T represents the kinetic energy.
For a micro-scale metal grain confined by grain boundaries of ~ 1μm diameter, we expect to
have N ≈ 1010 and Q{6}/N ≈ 10-3 ~ 10-4 eV, and hence we expect the excess heat and 4He
production due to reaction {6} but no nuclear ashes from some of the reactions described below
in section 4.
For nano-scale metal particles, the above consideration shows that excess energies (Q) lead to
a micro/nano-scale fire-work type explosion, creating a crater/cavity and a hot spot with fire-
work like star tracks. The size of a crater/cavity will depend on number of neighboring Pd
nanoparticles participating in BEC fusion almost simultaneously. Since sizes of deuteron and Pd
nucleus are of the order of ~10-4 o
A (~ 10 fm) while the average distance between two neighboring
Pd atoms is ~ 2.5
o
A , ~ 10 keV deuteron from the BEC deuterium fusion encounters mostly
electrons and transfers its kinetic energy to electrons. Occasionally, ~ 10 keV deuteron may
interact with Pd nucleus to initiate nuclear reactions, Pd(d,p)Rh, etc. When the BEC deuterium
fusion takes place in a Pd nanoparticle, exploding deuterons are expected to damage and leave
the host Pd nanoparticle, but some of the Pd nanoparticles may remain intact and may participate
again in the BEC deuterium fusion after absorbing again a sufficient number of deuterons, D/Pd
≥ 1.
4. Further Consequences of BEC Mechanism and of Selection Rule
Effects due to deuterons: Deuterons with Q{6}/N ≈ ~10 keV energy from reaction {6} can
undergo reactions {1} and {2} producing p(3.02 MeV), T(1.01 MeV), n(2.45 MeV), and
3He(0.82 MeV), which in turn will proceed with further reactions.
Tritons produced by reaction {1} (1.01 MeV triton) and by reaction {4} (average kinetic
energy of Q{4}/N ≈ ~keV) will interact with surrounding deuterons via the following reaction
{7} T + D → 4He(3.52 MeV) + n (14.07 MeV).
6
Because of triton kinetic energies of 1.01 MeV or ~ keV, the reaction rate for {7} could be large
enough to produce 14.07 MeV neutrons, which may have been recently observed by Forsley and
Mosier-Boss [20]. We note that 4He produced by reaction {7} has much higher kinetic energy
(3.52 MeV) compared with deuterons from reaction {6} (Q{6}/N ≈ ~10 keV).
Effects due to neutrons: Neutrons with 2.45 MeV kinetic energy from reaction {2}, neutrons
with Q{5}/N ≈ ~ keV kinetic energy from reaction {5}, or neutrons with 14.07 MeV kinetic
energy from reaction {7} can undergo further reactions, {8} and/or {9} below:
{8} n + D →T + γ + 6.26 MeV
{9} Neutron induced transmutation with other nuclei.
In addition, 14.07 MeV neutrons from reaction {7} may initiate reactions, 12C(n,n')3 4He and
12C(n,n'α)8Be(8Be→24He), which may have been recently observed by Mosier-Boss et al. [21].
Since reaction {8} produces more tritiums than neutrons, we expect R(T) > R(n), and also R (T)
> R(3He).
High deuterium loading requirement: D/Pd ≥ 1 is required for sustaining deuteron mobility in
Pd metal. The mobility of deuterons is required for the BEC mechanism.
Deuterium purity requirement: Because of violation of the selection rule, [Z1(D)/m1(D)] ≠
[Z2(p)/m2(p)], presence of hydrogens in deuteriums will surpress the formation of the BEC states,
thus diminishing the fusion rate due to the BEC mechanism. The required H/D ratio is expected
to be H/D < N-1. For a 5 nm Pd nanoparticle with N ≈ 104, H/D < 10-4, and hence 99.99 %
deuterium purity is required.
Heat after death: There have been observations of continued heat generation after the input for
experiment is switched off. This effect is known as “heat after death”. Because of mobility of
deuterons in Pd particle traps, a system of ~ 1022 deuterons contained in ~ 1018 Pd particle traps
(in 3g of Pd particles with average particle diameter of ~ Å50 ) is a dynamical system. BEC
states are continuously attained in a small fraction of the ~ 1018 Pd particle traps and undergo
BEC fusion processes, until the formation of the BEC state ceases or becomes negligible.
Enhancement by electromagnetic fields and laser stimulation: Application of
electromagnetic fields [2] and laser stimulation [22] have been shown to enhance the excess heat
production and other anomalous effects. These effects may be due to a decrease of the average
kinetic energy of mobile deuterons and/or to an increase of mobile deuterons participating in the
BEC fusion processes.
Increase of resistance: When the BECNF occurs, more mobile deuterons will be created. This
in turn will increase the resistance of metal. This effect may have been recently observed by
Celani et al. in deuterium gas loading experiments with Pd nanoparticles coated on a Pd wire
[23].
5. Experimental Tests of Theoretical Predictions
The first experimental test of the BEC mechanism for deuterium fusion with nano-scale Pd
particles was carried out with Pd blacks loaded by high-pressure deuterium gas [16]. The result
of this experiment shows no excess heat production. This may be due to the fact that Pd
nanoparticles (Pd Blacks) used had too large sizes (80 nm – 180 nm) and were clumped together
7
(not isolated). Furthermore, deuterium purity requirement was not satisfied. The recent report of
deuteron gas-loading experiment by Arata and Zhang [3] show positive results of observing
excess heat and 4He production using ~ 5 nm Pd particles imbedded in ZrO2 and purified
deuterium. For experimental tests of the predictions of the theory, it would be advantageous
scientifically to use samples of Pd nanoparticles deposited on thin films such as Al2O3/NiAl(111)
[24-26], even though bulk materials such as Pd nanoparticles imbedded in SiO2 aerogels [27] are
more suitable for practical applications. Other possibilities are to use other metals such as Zr or
Ti nanoparticles. In all cases, the theory requires that metal nanoparticles and micrograins are to
be separated from each other by boundaries.
Tests based on the average size of metal particles: From Eq. (6) with N=ND(π/6) 3
trapD , we
obtain 1 6
t trap trap trapR (D ) D or D ,  where Dtrap is the average trap diameter, assuming 1/3 2N or N , 
respectively. This can be tested experimentally. This result provides a theoretical justification
for using 50 Å Pd nanoparticles to maximize the total fusion rates.
Tests based on the temperature dependence: Since the probability Ω of the BEC ground state
occupation increases at lower temperatures (Ω ≈ 1 near T ≈ 0), the total fusion rate Rt will
increase at lower temperatures, Rt(Tlow) > Rt(Thigh). However, Rt is proportional to ND where ND
is the total number of mobile deuterons. Since ND(Tlow) < ND(Thigh), we expect Rt[ND(Tlow)] <
Rt[ND(Thigh)]. The above opposite temperature dependences for Rt will complicate analysis of the
temperature dependence of Rt.
Tests for reaction products and heat after death: Some examples of this type of tests are (1)
to look for micro/nano-scale craters/cavities and hot spots with micro/nano-scale fire-work like
star tracks at Pd nanoparticle sites, before and after death, and (2) to measure neutron energies to
check the reaction products carries kinetic energies of 2.45 MeV from the secondary reaction {2},
and Q{5}/N ~keV from reaction {5}.
Tests for increase of resistance: Resistance of the metal should be measured to test predicted
increase of resistance during the BECNF process.
Tests for scalability: One example is a scalability test based on the total number of Ntraps. Since
we have R N R N for the same R
t trap trap trap trap
  , we have theoretical prediction,
 R 30g Pd particles

6. Conclusion and Summary
Theory of the BEC mechanism described in this paper provides a consistent conventional
theoretical description of the results of many experimental works started by Fleischmann and
Pons in 1989 and by many others since then [1], including the recent work of Szpak, Mosier-
Boss, and Gordon [2] and the most recent work of Arata and Zhang [3]. Theory is based on the
concept of nuclear Bose-Einstein condensate state for mobile deuterons trapped in a micro/nano-
scale metal grain or particle, which acts as a confinement or trapping potential, similar to a
magnetic trap used to observe the atomic BEC phenomenon with atoms in 1995 [11-13]. To
validate this new concept of the nuclear BEC phenomenon, experimental tests for a set of key
theoretical predictions are proposed. Scalabilities of the observed effects are also discussed.
