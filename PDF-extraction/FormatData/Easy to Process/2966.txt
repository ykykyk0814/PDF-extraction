Abstract: Direct decomposition of water is very difficult to achieve in normal conditions. Hydrogen gas
can be usually obtained by electrolysis and a pyrolysis reaction at high temperatures above 3700 degrees
Celsius. However, as we have already reported, anomalous heat generation during plasma electrolysis is
relatively easy to obtain under the right simultaneous conditions of high temperature and electrolysis. In
this paper we discuss the anomalous amount of hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma
electrolysis. The generation of hydrogen in amounts exceeding Faradays law is continuously observed
when the conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable.
Non-Faradic generation of hydrogen gas is sometimes 80 times higher than the gas from normal
electrolysis. Excess hydrogen has proved difficult to replicate by other laboratories, although we are able
to reproduce it regularly.

Key word: plasma electrolysis, pyrolysis, hydrogen generation, current efficiency


1. Introduction
Hydrogen gas can be easily obtained by the electrolysis. However, direct decomposition of water is very
difficult in normal condition. The pyrolysis reaction occurs at high temperatures above 3700 degrees
Celsius (1, 2). We have already reported anomalous heat generation during plasma electrolysis (3, 4).
Some researchers have attempted to replicate the phenomenon, but it has been difficult for them to
generate large excess heat. They have tended to increase voltage to a very high value, around several
hundred volts, but they measured no excess heat.
We observe anomalous hydrogen and oxygen gas generation during plasma electrolysis. The generation
of hydrogen, which exceeds the Faraday law, is continuously observed when the conditions such as
temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Sometimes this non-Faradic
generation of hydrogen produces 80 times more hydrogen than normal electrolysis would. The plasma
state itself can usually be triggered fairly easily, when the input voltage is increased to 140V or above at
rather high temperature electrolysis cell (5, 6, 7). When the plasma forms, a great deal of vapor and the
hydrogen gas is released from the cell. This effluent gas removes much of the energy from the cell, and
with most conventional calorimeters this energy is not measured. This makes it difficult to calibrate, and to
establish the exact heat balance. This simultaneous heat release and the gas release are complicated and
difficult to measure. In this paper we show that anomalous hydrogen gas generation occurs during plasma
electrolysis. We will describe a heat measurement technique used during the plasma electrolysis to capture
all energy. This is important tool when replicating excess heat and other products during plasma
electrolysis.

2. Experiment
2.1 Electrolysis cell
Figure 1 shows the experimental set up. We can measure many parameters simultaneously: sample
surface temperature, neutron and x-ray emission, the mass spectrum of gas and input power and so on.
Figure 2 shows a schematic sketch of the cell and measurement system (1-2). The cell made of the Pyrex
glass, 10 cm diameter and 17 cm in height, 1000 ml capacity. A cap made of Teflon rubber was installed in
the cell. It is 7 cm in the diameter. The cap has several holes, three for platinum resistance temperature
probes (RTD), two for tube carrying flowing coolant water tube (the inlet and outlet), and one for a tube to
capture effluent hydrogen and oxygen gas, made of quartz, 5 cm in diameter and 12 cm in length. In
addition, the upper part of the tube is attached to a Teflon rubber cylinder with a water-cooled condenser
built into it, as shown in Fig. 3 and photo 4.

2.2 Measurement of hydrogen gas

A dome or funnel-shaped quartz glass surrounds the cathode, extending below it. It is 5 cm in
diameter, 12 cm in length. The effluent gas from the cathode  a mixture of hydrogen from electrolysis,
hydrogen and oxygen from pyrolysis, and water vapor from the intense heat  is captured inside the
funnel as it rises up to the surface of the electrolyte. After the gas rises to the top of the funnel, it passes
through a Teflon sleeve into a condenser. The water vapor condenses and falls back into the cell, and the
hydrogen and oxygen continues through an 8-mm diameter Tigon tube and a gas flow meter (Kofloc Corp.,
model 3100, controller model CR-700). This is a thermal flow meter; the flow detection element is a
heated tube. The minimum detectable flow rate is 0.001 cc/s, and the resolution is within 1%. The gas flow
measurement system is interfaced to a data logger, which is attached to a computer.

2.3 Calorimetry
As noted above, a quartz glass funnel surrounds the cathode. The anode is a mesh, wrapped around the
outside of this funnel. A Teflon tube, in turn, is wrapped around the anode mesh, and cooling water flows
through this tube. To summarize, the cathode is surrounded by a quartz glass funnel, the funnel outside
surface is wrapped in the anode mesh, and a cooling water tube is coiled around the anode mesh. A
platinum resistance temperature probes (RTD) is installed inside the tube, where the tube enters the cell
system, and another RTD is installed where the tube exits the cell. (We call this the system here because
after the cooling water passes the inlet RTD, it flows through the condenser above the cell, where it
captures a great deal of heat, then it enters the Teflon tube in the cell, then finally it exits the cell and runs
past the outlet RTD.) The temperature difference between the outlet and inlet RTDs is used to perform
flow calorimetry on the cooling water.
Another set of three RTDs are mounted in the electrolyte, at different depths in the cell, to measure cell
temperature and to perform isoperibolic calorimetry. A magnetic stirrer keeps the solution in the cell well
mixed. The amount of the heat generation was determined by combining results from the flow and
isoperibolic calorimetry and continuously comparing these two results with the input electric power.
Figure 5 shows the notional sketch of the heat measurement system. Heat out can be divided into several
factors. These are: energy required for water decomposition; heat of electrolyte; heat removed by the
coolant (the flowing cooling water in the Teflon tube); heat released from the call wall; and heat released
with the vapor that exists through the cell plug outlet hole.

Fig. 5. Schematic representation of heat balance

The heat balance is determined for input and output two formulas:

•Input (J) = I (current) ･ V(Volt) ･ t
•Out = Hg + Hw + HC + Hr + Hv
here, Hg = Heat of decomposition =∫1.48 ･ dI ･ dt
Hw = Electrolyte heat  = ∫Ww ･ Cw ･δT
•       Ww:electrolyte weight,Cw:heat capacity,δT:temperature difference
Hc = Heat of coolant  =  ∫Wc ･ Cc ･δT
•        Wc:coolant weight, Cc:heat capacity,δT:temperature difference
•Hr = Heat release  =  ∫(Ww ･Cw + Wc ･ Cc)Tr
•         Tr: temperature change
•     Hv = vapor = Wv ･ Cc

The calculation of the heat balance is relatively simple, despite the many factors that have to be taken into
account. Input power is from the electric power source only. Output is divided to several parts. The first is
Hg is heat of water decomposition. It is easily calculated from the total electric current. Hw is the
electrolyte heat energy. It is also easy to calculate, based on the difference between the solution
temperature and ambient. Hc is heat removed by the coolant. It is also easy to measure from the
temperature difference between the coolant temperature at the inlet and outlet to the flow calorimetry
system. The forth factor is Hr, heat release from the cell. This is rather complicated and can be determined
by a semi-empirical equation. The fifth factor, Hv, is heat release by vapor from the cell. This is difficult to
measure precisely. However, we have captured most of this heat directly by running the flow-calorimetry
cooling water flow through the condenser.
If there is excess hydrogen and oxygen gas, we have to measure the gas volume precisely to determine
how much energy it removes from the system. The equation for first factor, Hg, water decomposition was
based on Faradays law in the first approximation. It has to be changed to account for excess gas. The new
equation can be based on the amount of hydrogen gas measured by the flow meter.

2.4 Electrode and solution
A tungsten wire 1.5 mm in diameter and 15 cm in length was used as the electrode, the upper 13 cm of
the wire was covered with shrink-wrap Teflon, and the bottom 2 cm was exposed to electrolyte, and acted
as the electrode. The light water solution was made from ultra high purity K2CO3 reagent at 0.2M
concentration.

3. Result
We changed the input voltage stepwise as shown in Fig. 10. In this case, plasma electrolysis occurred at
120V. Once plasma formed, input current suddenly dropped. Meanwhile, the solution temperature rose to
around 80 degrees. We then increased the voltage as stepwise to 350V, and then decreased it to 100V.
Plasma continued at 100V and ceased at 80V.

Fig. 11. Changes of the ion current of various masses
Figure 12 shows the time changes for hydrogen and oxygen molecules and their ratio. The ratio increase
as input voltage increases. It is 0.45 at 2500s, at 350 V. This means the gas from the cathode was
decomposed water. The ratio of the hydrogen in gases released from the cathode is exactly same as the value
that indicated by the current. The equation is (Fl-0.116I)*0.667+0.116I. Here, Fl is the rate of hydrogen gas
estimated from the flow meter and I is current. The factor of 0.116 is determined from the rate of ordinal
hydrogen generation that is 0.5*22414/F (F; Faraday constant of 96500). And the factor of 0.667 is atomic
ratio of hydrogen for water.

Fig. 12. Time changes of H2 and O2 ion current and the ratio

Figure 13 shows the changes of hydrogen generation estimated from the current and measured by the flow
meter. These rates were the same in ordinary electrolysis. However, the value measured by the flow meter
shows an upward deviation compared the value estimated from the current.
The change of the ratio between these two values, i.e., current efficiency (ε) and the ratio of the oxygen
gas to the total generation with hydrogen from the cathode are shown in Fig. 4C. Here, theεexceeded
unity when plasma electrolysis started; gas generation increased a great deal with the input voltage. It
reached as 8000% at 350V. The ratio of oxygen reached 30%. This means that almost all water
decomposition in the cell was a caused by the high voltage plasma. In other words, pyrolysis
decomposition occurred.

Figure 14 shows the change of the ratio between these two values, i.e., current efficiency (ε) and the ratio of
the oxygen gas to the total generation with hydrogen from the cathode. Here, theεexceeded unity when
plasma electrolysis started; the gas generation increased a great deal as input voltage rose. It reached 8000%
at 350V of input voltage. The theoretical value of hydrogen generation calculated from the input current
was 1144 cc, and the measurement value during plasma electrolysis was 2190 cc. That is, the generation of
excess hydrogen during a whole electrolysis run reached 1046 cc. If we consider only hydrogen generated
during plasma conditions, the measured value was 1470 cc, the theoretical value is 460, and the excess is
1010 cc.

Figure 15 shows theεand V relationship. Here, it can be shown that εhas a tendency of increase with
input voltage. Some points ofεvalue under 100V in the figure show up to twice of the theoretical value of
unity; these points were obtained during plasma electrolysis. On the other hand,εremains at unity for all of
the normal electrolysis runs. It can be expected that if the input voltage were increased to several hundred V,
then εwould far exceed unity.

An example of heat generation is shown in Fig. 17. This shows no excess during the measurement.
However, in this experiment, heat release with the oxygen evolution was not measured. So, it can be only
said that in this case the heat balance was almost 100%.

heat was estimated as 1100J during plasma electrolysis. In all three cases shown here, I accounted for the
contribution of energy from excess hydrogen formation. However, the apparent heat balance was close to or
below unity. It was affected by other parameters.

We analyzed the elements in the electrode and the electrolyte by EDX and XPS method to estimate the
entire distribution of elements in the electrolysis system. After electrolysis, the difference of the element
deposition for these three cases were changed as indicated in Fig. 21. These depositions were also observed
in various cases of the electrolysis systems (8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
There were several major elements observed in the systems when excess energy was released. These were
Ca, Fe and Zn. And other hand, In and Ge were detected for the case of endothermic heat. However, we have
no major elements detected in the system when no heat phenomenon occurred.

4. Results
It is still difficult to determine what conditions are needed for excess energy generation. However, it is
apparent that we must account for the contribution of the excess hydrogen to measure excess. Sometimes the
excess hydrogen energy was as much as 30% of the input energy. This was in addition to excess heat
already measured with calorimetry. However, duration of the excess energy generation only continued for
several hundred seconds. One of the key factors controlling excess energy production seems to be input
voltage. Hydrogen generation and heat generation seems to correlate with the input voltage. It can go over
unity for the energy output during plasma electrolysis if the input voltage was kept very high. Apparently, we
have replicated the phenomenon that the excess heat generation had been occasionally occurred at high input
voltage region, even if the duration time was not enough long. One point ofεvalue in the figure shows up to
80 times of the theoretical value of unity; the point was obtained by the result of plasma electrolysis at 350V.
On the other hand, theεremains at unity for all of the other normal electrolysis. It can be expected that if the
input voltage were increased to several hundred volts, the heat out would far exceed the value of unity.


5. Conclusions
1. Current efficiency for plasma electrolysis reaches 8,000% of the input current.
2. Power efficiency for plasma electrolysis reaches 30% to the input voltage.
3. In some cases, excess heat was observed.
4. In other cases, no excess endothermic heat were observed.
5. The reaction products after electrolysis were different when excess heat was generated.
