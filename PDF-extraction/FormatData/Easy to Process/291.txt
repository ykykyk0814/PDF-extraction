Executive Summary
Experimental work was undertaken to reproduce a specific observation of the gas-phase Anomalous Heat
Effect (AHE)*.  This task required the production of a quantity of heat energy by a mass of material so
small that the origin of the energy cannot be attributable to a chemical process.  The gas-phase form of
AHE is difficult to reproduce and hence lacks a measure of credibility.  The goal is to enhance its credibility
by reproducing results first demonstrated in Japan and later reproduced in the U.S. by a solitary investigator.
The technique heated nanometer-sized Ni:Pd particles (20:1 molar ratio) embedded in micron-sized
particles of an inert refractory of ZrO2. It was not within the purview of this work to investigate the physical
origin of the AHE effect or speculate on its source.
An apparatus was built that comprised identical test and a reference heated cells.  These thermally isolated
cells each contained two thermocouples and a 10 cm3 volume of ZrO2NiPd particles.  Calibration functions
to infer thermal power from temperature were created by electrically heating the filled cells with known
powers when they were either evacuated or pressurized with 1 bar of N2.  During the experimental trial, the
test cell was pressurized with hydrogen and the control cell was pressurized with nitrogen.  After
conditioning the cells, both were heated to near 300°C for a period of 1000 hours (40 days).  During this
period, the test cell registered 7.5% more power (approximately 1 W) than the input power. The control
cell measured approximately 0.05 W of excess power.  The error in the excess power measurement was
±0.05 W.
Time-integrating the excess power to obtain an excess energy and normalizing to the 20 gram mass of the
ZrO2NiPd sample yields a specific energy of 173 MJ/kg. Assuming that the active material is the 5.44g of
Ni+Pd yields a specific energy of 635 MJ/kg.  For comparison, the highest specific energy of a hydrocarbon
fuel (methane) is 55.5 MJ/kg. The highest chemical specific energy listed [see Energy Density in
Wikipedia] is 142 MJ/kg for hydrogen compressed to 700 bar. Based on these results, it is unlikely that the
source of heat energy was chemical in origin.

* The expression Anomalous Heat Effect (AHE) introduced by Dr. Robert Duncan will be used in this report to refer
to a phenomenon often called Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), Condensed Matter Nuclear Science
(CMNS), the old misnomer Cold Fusion, or several other names. The AHE moniker has the advantage that it only
references the principal experimental manifestation while agnostic to the many theories attesting to its unknown
physical origin.

1. Introduction
The study of the Anomalous Heat Effect (AHE) has a colorful history.  Initially introduced via a press
conference by two electrochemists in 1989 [1], it received worldwide attention due to the claim that the
energy generated was orders of magnitude greater than that possible by chemical reactions. This energy
was generated without producing radiation characteristic of nuclear reactions.  Because the process
occurred at low temperatures in an electrolysis cell, it was given the unfortunate moniker “Cold Fusion.”
This attracted numerous unsuccessful efforts to duplicate the results from the scientific community using
an incomplete description of the experiment. Subsequently, the work was labeled junk science and the
scientific hierarchy in the United States made it nearly impossible to publish or obtain funding for its study.
However, studies did continue outside the U.S. and at low levels in the U.S. funded by non-traditional
sources.  Due to these subsequent studies, it is now understood why it was difficult to reproduce the energy
releases observed the original electrolysis experiments.  [2]
During these succeeding studies, a gas-phase manifestation of the AHE was discovered in Italy. [3] This is
significant for two reasons. First, this new method used readily available nickel and light hydrogen instead
of the expensive palladium and deuterium used in the electrolysis experiments.  Second, the gas-phase
experiments operated at much higher temperatures than the atmospheric-pressure heavy water electrolysis
experiments, thus promising greater conversion efficiency to electrical or mechanical power.
Unfortunately, most investigations of AHE have focused on electrolysis experiments leaving gas-phase
AHE relatively unstudied. Consequently, critical parameters required for observing this manifestation are
ill-defined.  These include particle surface morphology, required hydrogen loading density, and triggering
mechanisms.  These known unknowns (and possibly other unknown unknowns) have made demonstrations
of gas-phase AHE difficult to reproduce.
Because a practical implementation of the gas-phase AHE has the potential to transform the commercial
and national security space industries by, for example, eliminating massive solar arrays, a small program
was initiated at The Aerospace Corporation to see if the AHE could be observed in our laboratory.  Because
it was an internally funded modest program, the goal was not to create a research effort to study its origin
but to demonstrate reproducibility of previous work. If demonstration was successful and convincing, the
hope was that this work would stimulate a subsequent larger effort.
To this end, a review of the gas-phase AHE results was made when this project was initiated in 2013 to find
an observation likely to be reproduced.  Three criteria were considered to increase probability of achieving
this goal: a complete description of material preparation was required; a simple triggering mechanism was
desirable to reduce the experimental complexity; and at least one reproduction of the manifestation of
excess heat† of non-chemical origin using the method should be documented by an independent
investigator.  At the time of this survey, only the work by Arata and Zhang [4] in Japan as reproduced by
Ahern [5] in the United States met these three requirements.‡  This method employs a simple heat-triggering
mechanism on a powder of micron-sized particles of ZrO2 imbedded with nanometer-sized particles of a
nickel (with a small admixture of palladium).  The active material used in the work presented in this report
differs from that of Refs. [4] and [5] by the addition of magnetic particles.  This addition was made with
the desire of increasing the probability of observing excess energy, based on reports by other investigators

† Most AHE experiments require input heat power to raise the temperature of the sample material to a value above a
critical temperature. If more heat is generated than supplied to the sample, this difference (exothermic) heat is called
“excess heat.”  If the integrated excess heat power over the duration of the experiment (= excess energy) is more
than can be attributed to chemical energy, the observation of the AHE is considered positive.
‡ We note since this work was initiated, other demonstrations of the AHE of NiPd nanoparticles in a ZrO2 matrix
have been documented.  Examples can be found in Special Section: Low Energy Nuclear Reactions of Current
Science Vol. 108 No. 4 (2015) available at:

[6] and the initial experimental trial in this work. Other than these additional particles, the material used
here was identical to that used by Refs. [4] and [5].
The tasks undertaken to implement this demonstration include base material acquisition and sample
fabrication, design and construction of the computer-controlled experimental apparatus, creation of robust
data acquisition (DAQ) software, system calibration, extended periods of data acquisition, and data analysis
and interpretation.  Completion of these tasks produced two experimental trials, each using two parallel
cells controlled and monitored by a single DAQ computer. The first trial served primarily as a learning
vehicle for developing and testing an experimental protocol.  Its results are not discussed in the body of this
report; however, its design, with lessons learned, and the data produced during this 23-day run are
interesting so its description is presented in Appendix A.
The duration of second experiment trial was over 1600 hours (67 days). It is described in detail in the report
preceded by sections presenting the preparation of the sample and the description of the apparatus.  The

final section of the report presents an error discussion and conclusions.  To improve the readability of the
body of this document, many details are presented in nine appendices.

2. Sample Preparation
The samples were prepared following a prescription
described by Ahern [5], who drew his procedures from
those developed by Arata and Zhang [4].  This type of
preparation was developed for the fabrication of catalysts,
which require large metallic surface areas that operate at
high temperatures.  Large specific areas require small
particles that will sinter into large particles at high
temperatures.  Thus techniques were developed to imbed
small metallic particles in large porous inert refractory
particles.
The base metallic material was prepared by Ames
Laboratory [7] by arc melting a 90 gram mixture of 65wt%
Zr 32wt% Ni 3wt% Pd using 99.95% purity elements.
This hot composite was melt-spun onto a water-cooled
copper hearth plate in an atmosphere of high purity argon
using a wheel speed of 25 m/s and an ejection pressure of 110 Torr.  This procedure was repeated, each run
creating approximately 10 grams melt spun ribbons.  A view of ribbon from one of these spins is shown in
Figure 2.1.
At The Aerospace Corporation ribbon from a 10 gram single run was placed in a furnace and heated in air
at 440°C for 28 hours.  This created approximately 12 grams of brittle material comprising nickel and
palladium nano-particles in a ZrO2 matrix.  This material was hand-ground in a mortar and pestle for a few
minutes creating jagged particle with diameters of a few
hundred microns in diameter.  Subsequently the ground
sample was placed in a 45 mL zirconia ceramic vial with
two 12.7 mm diameter zirconia balls and ground in
mixer/mill [8] for 4 minutes.  Macroscopic and
microscopic views of the sample before and after it was
placed in the mill are shown in Figures 2.2 and 2.3,
respectively.  The mill created particles that were a few
microns in diameter with a few as large as 40 microns.
Milling the sample for less than 4 minutes left many large
jagged particles.  Milling for 4 minutes ground most of the
large particle but generally created particles smaller than
the targeted 10–30 micron diameter size distribution.
There have been reports that a magnetic field can enhance
the AHE (for example, see Ref. [6]).  To explore this
possibility, for the first experiment it was decided to run a
second cell loaded with magnetic material in parallel with
the first.  The material in this cell was a mixture of
approximately equal weights of a milled SmCo 2-17
magnet and the ZrO2NiPd sample described above. A
discussion on the choice of a SmCo magnet rather than a
NdFeB magnet which usually has a higher magnetic field
strength is given in Appendix B.

Because the magnet particles stick together tightly in a single mass after they are ground, the ZrO2NiPd
sample and the magnetic sample were placed together in the Mixer/Mill after they were individually ground
in the mortar and pestle.  The hope was that milling them together would facilitate their mixing.  This was
partially successful. A view of the mixture of the SmCo magnet particles with the ZrO2NiPd sample is
shown in Figure 2.4.  In this photo the large particles are the SmCo, and ZrO2NiPd particles are on the
surface of the magnet particles.

3. Experimental Design
The method chosen for gas-phase AHE reproduction required only thermal triggering. This required
building cells that could be heated in vacuum to temperatures near 400o C.  The design described here
accomplishes this principally using off-the-shelf parts.
The cell design used in the first experimental trial
(described in Appendix A) is shown in Figure 3.1.
It uses a Swagelok 10 cc stainless steel sample
cylinder, standard Swagelok fittings, mounted on a
2.75 inch diameter conflat flange.  This flange is
installed on a standard 5 inch long x 1.5 inch
diameter stainless steel (SS) nipple with a 2.75 inch
conflat flanges on both ends.  The guiding principle
was to build a thermally isolated container for the
sample that has little heat capacity so that a small
energy release will cause a large, easily measured
temperature rise.  The volume around the sample
cylinder is evacuated by a mechanical pump§
whereas the interior of the sample cell is evaluated
to a few microbar (mTorr) using a turbo-pump
backed by a diaphragm pump, keeping the sample
oil free.  The 3/8 inch Swaglock fitting connecting
the sample cylinder to the conflat flange was a poor
thermal insulator, producing some conduction
heating the outer vacuum cylinder.
The small size of the configuration required that feedthroughs
for the power leads and thermocouples be custom made.
Unfortunately, suitable thermocouples could not be
purchased so they were made in-house by torch fusing 0.010”
diameter chromel-alumel wire (type K) and using a
combination of porcelain beads and glass-sleeve high-
temperature insulators.  One of the interior cell feedthroughs
and thermocouple is shown in Figure 3.2 mounted on ¼ inch
Swagelok fittings.
As shown in Figure 3.1, the sample cylinder was spiral
wound with bare nichrome wire.  It was desired to electrically
insulate this wire from the SS cylinder while keeping good
thermal conductivity to the cylinder.  Initially, the cylinder
was coated with high-temperature paint before wrapping the
wire. (See Figure 3.3.)  Of several coatings tried, Aremco [9]
Pyro-Paint 634-ZO worked the best.

§ The mechanical pump available had a rather high base pressure of 0.08 mbar (60 mTorr).  This reduced the thermal
conductivity of the air by only 30%, whereas a well-maintained two-stage rotary vane pump would have reduced by
thermal conductivity of air factor of 24 from the atmospheric pressure value.  See Appendix I.

However, even though this paint is rated for a temperature
of 1800°C, it repeatedly failed causing the circuit to short
when the interior cell temperatures reached 400°C.
Subsequently, the nichrome wire was threaded through a
woven glass sleeve [10] and then wrapped round the
cylinder as shown in Figure 3.4.  This configuration
proved robust, allowing calibration to be performed up to
450°C.  The nichrome wire (OMEGA PN NI60-012-50,
NI60.CR16) [11] had a room temperature resistance of
4.359 Ω /ft. Cell #1 in the experiments described below
had a resistance of 14.9 Ω and cell #2 a resistance of 15.3
Ω.  Accordingly, when the power suppliers were used in
constant voltage mode, the power delivered to the cells
differed slightly.
Applying the lessons learned from the first experimental trail as discussed in Appendix A, the cell design
was modified.  Figure 3.5 shows the design (left) and a photo (right) of the cells and thermocouple inserts
used in the principal (second) experimental trial.  Again the cell assemblies were designed to fit inside a
standard 2.75 inch conflate nipple SS vacuum jacket.  The wall the SS cells were thinned to about half of
their original thicknesses to reduce the heat capacities, temperature gradients, and decrease the thermal time
constants.  The thermocouples were coated with high temperature Aremco Pyro-Paint 670 and threaded
through the SS tubing. Using longer tubes to support the cells and inserting two thermocouples instead of
one in a cell made filling the cells with the 26 grams of the material tedious.  Unfortunately, initial vacuum
tests on the new cells indicated a vacuum leak in one of them.  Because time did not permit new part
acquisition and building another cell, this leak was patched with Torrseal.
The cells were loaded with the samples, the interior thermocouples installed into the cells, and the cells
were placed in their individual vacuum jackets.  Subsequently, the assemblies were installed in the gas
manifold shown in Figure 3.6.  The interior of the cells were evacuated with a Varian minitask pump
comprising a 70 L/s turbo pump backed by a diaphragm pump creating an ultimate pressure just above the
pump orifice of a few tenths of a microbar** (millitorr).  As noted, this system created an oil-free vacuum.

** The principal unit for pressure used in this document is “bar.”  For conversion to SI units 1 bar = 100 kPa exactly
and is referenced to vacuum.

Figure 3.7 shows the power and data acquisition systems.  The power is delivered individually to each cell
by two Rigol 1116A computer controlled power supplies operated in constant voltage mode.  The voltage,
current, and power delivered is that reported by the instrument; the voltage and current values were checked
with an Agilent 34301A multimeter (IBS ABE983, Cal Due Date 2/21/16) and agreed to ± 0.002 V, ± 0.002
A).
The Rigol M301 data acquisition system read the voltages from the pressure transducers and the
thermocouples.  The two pressure transducers [12] had a voltage output range of 0 – 5 V to cover the
pressure range of 0 to 285 PSIA (20 bar).  The Rigol M301 temperature output values of the type K
thermocouples were calibrated (adjusted) at 0°C (ice bath) and 240o C (hot glycerin) with a linear function
using an Omega HH309A thermocouple readout (IBS ACH235, Cal Due Date 6/14/15).
Although the Rigol M301 DAQ system is well documented to supply a reference junction for the
temperature measurements, it did not.  Consequently, there could be variations with the reported
temperature if the room temperature were to change.  The room temperature was monitored throughout the
data acquisition period and compensation was made during the data analysis.  This is discussed further in
the next section. It is estimated that the temperatures are accurate to ± 0.5°C.
All communication to the Rigol instruments was through a USB port on a laptop computer.  The instrument
controlling software was written in MATLAB® using the MATLAB Instrument Control Toolbox, which
sent SCPI text commands that were recognized by the instruments.  Intermediate results of a few hours
could be viewed as a series of strip-chart graphs on the computer screen.  The results from the entire
experimental run could also be viewed on another set of graphs on the screen albeit with lower temporal
fidelity.  Data were taken at 30 second intervals and appended to a data file, ensuring that any experimental
interruption would not result in a loss of data.  This file could be downloaded for detailed analysis at any
time without interrupting the experiment.
Due to the long duration of a continuous data acquisition period, an important element in the experimental
configuration was the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).  The battery in the laptop computer made the
this controller immune to power interruptions but each of the Rigol instruments required an individual UPS
to allow the experiment to operate through a loss of grid power of at least two hours.  There were two power
interruptions during the experimental runs.  Any interruption would have compromised the results.

4. Principal Experiment Trial
To increase credibility of the second trial results, the active test cell and an inert reference cell were loaded
with identical material. However, the test cell was pressurized with hydrogen and the reference cell with
nitrogen.  The mass of the ZrO2NiPd powder in each cell was doubled from the first trial to 20 grams.
Furthermore, since the first experimental trial indicated that the magnetic particles may have increased the
generation of the excess heat (see Appendix A), a sufficient mass of SmCo particles (6 grams) was added
to fill the remainder of the 10 cm3 cell volume.  Other differences from the first trial were the use of
hydrogen instead of deuterium gas and ZrO2NiPd powder as ground to < 1 µm diameter.
Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show slices form the 3D x-ray tomographic imaging taken of cell #1 and cell #2,
respectively.  Images of both cells show that some of the material remained in the neck of the cells.  This
trapped material was later pushed into the cell using a fine wire, filling the remainder of the cells without
disturbing the material and thermocouple placement in the body of the cells.  These images show the
thermocouples are separated by at least 3 mm from each other and each are displaced from the cell walls.
The high atomic weight SmCo magnetic particles appear as bright particles in these images

4.1 Bakeout and Calibration
After installation into the experiment apparatus (Figure 3.6), the cells were evacuated for bake-out.  The
vacuum bake-out comprised a period of 20 hours between 160°C and 260°C and 22 hours between 320°C
and 340°C.  The highest pressure registered during this procedure was 22 mTorr (0.03 mbar) at 300°C, after
which the pressure decreased to 4 mTorr (0.005 mbar) even as the temperature increased to 340°C. After
cooling to room temperature the pressure of the cells was near 1 mTorr (0.0013 mbar).
After bakeout, the recorded trial run of
duration 1610 hours (67 days) began.
The data from this period are discussed
sequentially. Calibration began at time
zero. The power, temperature and
pressure curves of the cells during
calibration are shown in Figure 4.3. Note
that it requires several hours to reach an
equilibrium temperature after a power
change. For the temperatures where full
equilibrium was not reached, a small
extrapolation was used to obtain the
equilibrium temperature. Better thermal
isolation of the cell increases the time to
reach equilibrium.  Note the nitrogen
pressure curves during the 1 bar
calibration.  In cell 2, the pressure
remains constant except for small
variations with temperature.  If the entire
volume of the gas were heated from
room temperature to 300°C, one would
expect a 2X increase in pressure.  The

increase of 0.1 bar at 340°C indicates that only about 10% of the gas volume is heated; the remainder is in
the unheated gas manifold.  There is a slight indication of a lower pressure after the cell 2 returns to room
temperature, which indicates a pressure decrease rate of about 0.5 mbar/hr.  In cell 1 the N2 pressure
decreases at a rate of about 0.2 bar/50 hours = 4 mbar/hr. This could indicate a leak with a rate of 0.4%/hr
if independent of pressure.
Eight calibration curves were created, one for each thermocouple in each cell in vacuum and at 1 bar N2
gas.  However, because there was no significant difference between the calibration curves for the two
thermocouples in a given cell there are effectively only four curves.
These four calibration curves for the cells are given in Figure 4.4. Note that the difference between the
calibration curves for the two cells is significant as is, to a lesser degree, the difference for a given cell for
the two pressures. At temperatures between 250°C and 300°C, the range of temperatures where the
experiment was operated, the system sensitivity is between 12°C/W and 13°C/W, about 50% better than
that of the first experiment.  The third order polynomials used to generate the curves shown in Figure 4.4
and used to infer the power from the temperature are:
PwrC1T1Vac = 0.0000002467 T3 + 0.0000055991 T2 + 0.0256426972 T - 0.5841432429

The fits for these polynomials had R2 values of greater than 0.99999.

It is interesting to compare the difference between
the vacuum and 1 bar N2 calibrations for a given cell.
This is done in Table 1 for cell 1.  This difference in
inferred power goes from an insignificant 0.03 W at
50°C to a significant 0.6 W at 300°C, with the
inferred power for the vacuum case greater than that
of the 1 bar N2 case.  That is, it requires more power
to achieve a given temperature if the cell is at a lower
pressure than a higher pressure after the cell has
reached thermal equilibrium.  A possible explanation
is that the nitrogen creates a more efficient thermal
path between the heater wires and the thermocouples
and this effect is greater than the increase in the
conductive loss path cooling the thermocouple.  This
would imply a thermal gradient exists in the cell after
equilibrium is reached. Another possible explanation
is that nitrogen gas is reacting exothermically with
one or more of the compounds; i.e., ZrO2, Ni, Pd,
SmCo or possibly Zr that was not converted to ZrO2
(N2 does react with Zr to create ZrN; for example,

Figure 4.5 Gas loading curves.

11
see Ref. [13]).  However, this second scenario is considered unlikely.  The origin of this difference will

remain speculative but the assumption will be made that whatever its origin it does not change during the
course of the experiment and the calibration curves can be used to infer the power.
4.2 Conditioning and Hydrogen Loading
The cells were then loaded with gas, H2 in cell 1 and N2 in cell 2 as shown in Figure 4.5. The loading
pressure was nominally 4.5 bars.  The heat capacity for both gases is nearly the same but the thermal
conductivity of hydrogen is 7 times greater than that of nitrogen at room temperature (see Appendix C and
the end of Section 5).  In cell 2, we observe a constant decrease in N2 pressure at a rate of 15 mbar/hr with
the cell remaining at a constant temperature.  This is much larger than the pressure decrease rate of 0.5
mbar/hr seen in cell 2 during the N2 calibration run. In cell 1, the H2 loading was done in three steps resulting
in pressure decrease rates of 137 mbar/hr, 187 mbar/hr, and 105 mbar/hr. These rates are also much larger
than the 4 mbar/hr rate observed for this cell during the N2 calibration run.  Finally we note the 25°C
temperature rise in cell 1 at the beginning of the first H2 loading.  Loading H2 into nickel or palladium is an
exothermic process and this temperature rise was routinely observed in loading into this ZrO2Ni powder.
[5]
The data in Figure 4.5 can be used to estimate the hydrogen gas absorbed.  Noting that the change in pressure
due to the three pressurizations = 2.6 +1.5 +1.9 = 6.0 bar, and assuming only 20% of the volume 10 cm3
cell is empty and the gas manifold has an estimated volume of 8 cm3, the total volume is approximately 10
cm3.  Then from the ideal gas law, the number of moles of H2 absorbed is
nH2 = 6 bar x 10 cm3/(2.24 x 104 cm3-atm /mole x 0.987 bar/atm) = 2.7 x 10-3 mole of H2
The moles of nNi = 4.98g/58.7 g/mole = 0.11 moles (see Appendix F).  Assuming that only the nickel atoms
adsorb the atoms of hydrogen then the fraction of Ni atoms with H atoms is moles of H atoms/moles of Ni
= 2 x 2.7 x 10-3 mole of H2/0.11 = 4.9%.  This represents an upper limit on the number of Ni atoms with H
atoms as there could be H2 loss to other mechanisms. As noted below, it is likely that most of the hydrogen
is adsorbed by the palladium.  There are 4.32 x 10-3 moles of Pd in the cell (Appendix F); if all the hydrogen
atoms were adsorbed by palladium, the palladium loading would be about 125%, indicating that some of
the hydrogen atoms are adsorbed in the Ni or elsewhere.
It is instructive to calculate the amount of energy added to the cell due to work of ∆P x V.  Using 6 bars for
the pressure change and 10 cm3 for the volume we obtain 6 J. During the 40-hour loading period, the average
power is 4 x 10-5 W.  Near room temperature the cell constant is 27°C/0.7 W = 38°C/W.  The resultant
temperature change of 0.002°C would not be observable.
The exothermic energy causing the temperature rise seen in the upper graph of Figure 4.5 near 147 hours
is calculated to be 1120 J (see Appendix G). Assuming that 100kJ/mole of energy is released when adsorbed
by the surface of Pd [14] implies 0.011 moles of H2 are adsorbed by Pd.  This is four times the value of
hydrogen calculated in the adsorption estimate above.
4.3 Power Ramp-up Period
After the calibration and fill, the power run was initiated to trigger the AHE.  This is done using two
computer-controlled regulated DC power supplies (Rigol Model 1116A) in voltage regulated mode to heat
the nichrome wire heaters wound around the sample cells.  The voltage was set to different values for the
two cells in order to have approximately the same registered temperature in each cell.  The input power to
each cell was recorded from power supply digital output, which was found to be accurate to better than
0.1% by comparing to an Agilent calibrated multimeter.

12
It is worth studying the power ramp up period that took place between 190 and 270 hours for the hydrogen
cell (#1).  These data are shown in Figure 4.6.  Date/times are marked on this graph; the times appearing
red indicate the times where the power or pressure was changed.  The left of the graph shows the end of the
loading period given in Figure 4.5.  Near 191 hours the hydrogen pressure was vented to pressure of 1.2
bar and 6 W of power was applied to the cell heating coil raising its internal temperature to just under
200°C.  This temperature rise caused the (presumably H2) pressure to rise to 2.0 bars; subsequently this
hydrogen was reabsorbed over the next 5 hours reaching a minimum pressure of about 0.8 bar.  Over the
next 65 hours as the cell continued to be heated, this pressure gradually increased to a value slightly above
1 bar at 263 hours when the heater power was again increased in two steps resulting in a two-step increase
in the pressure, peaking at a value of greater than 2.8 bars at 273 hours.  This pressure decreased rapidly
for the next 10 hours reaching to 0.6 bar at 290 and continued to decrease slowly to a value of < 0.05 bar at
1650 hours as seen below.
One may speculate to the cause of these pressure variations.  As noted in Section 2, the active material in
the cells is nano-particles of nickel and palladium metal in a matrix of ZrO2 micron-sized particles, the mole
ratio of Ni:Pd being 19.6:1.  However, hydrogen solubility is 105 times greater in Pd than in Ni at 200°C
and greater at lower temperatures. [15]   Thus it is likely that most of the hydrogen was absorbed by the
palladium during the room temperature loading period and, when heated, a significant amount of this
hydrogen was released.  This is, of course, the mechanism used for hydrogen storage and retrieval in
palladium. [16]  During the course of the reabsorption, some of this hydrogen was absorbed by the nickel.
Absorption of hydrogen in Ni is largely a surface effect whereas it is a volume effect in Pd.
4.4 Power Generation Period
Figure 4.7 shows the data for both cells during the portion of the run dedicated to measuring the excess heat
power and energy. This interval lasted approximately 1000 hours (42 days).  The scaling for each of the
data traces is given in the legend.  The temperature of each cell is shown by the magenta trace and the input
power is depicted by the blue line.  The light blue line records the pressure in units of bar.  The red trace
records the excess power; that is, the power inferred from the cell temperature using the appropriate
calibration algorithm minus the input power.

Figure 4.6 Hydrogen cell during preheating.

13
We begin with a few general observations.  First we see that the light blue pressure traces indicate the
pressure in the hydrogen cell asymptotically approaches zero where the pressure in the nitrogen cell remains
nearly constant during the 1050 hour interval shown.  Also note that cell 1 required 1.6 watts additional
power to maintain the same temperature as cell 2.  This is consistent with the calibration data shown in
Figure 4.4 for the cell 1 vacuum calibration and the cell 2 1-bar calibration.  The difference between the
interior thermocouple temperatures (T1-T2) during the energy integrations period was -0.3 ±0.1°C and -0.5
±0.1°C for cells 1 and 2 respectively (see Appendix D).
The red traces depict the excess power calculated by using the thermocouple reading from the cell interior
to infer the cell heat power (employing the vacuum calibration algorithm for cell 1 and the 1-bar algorithm
for cell 2) and subtracting the input power recorded for the respective cells (i.e., Pexcess = Pinferred – Pin).
These traces show large excursions from their mean values whenever the power (i.e., temperature) was
changed.  This is because the algorithm used equilibrium temperatures and 3+ hours are required to reach
this equilibrium.  During this transition period, a large negative excursion appeared for an increase in
applied power and a positive excursion for a decrease in applied power.
Note that both red excess power traces show a 24 hour periodicity.  The light black trace on the cell 2
(lower) plot is an arbitrarily scaled (∆ = 0.2 in ordinate = 1°C) thermocouple reading that recorded the room
temperature near the cells (the apparent shift of 0.5°C at 600 hours is due to changing the location of this
thermocouple).  The peak-to-trough magnitude of this room temperature curve is on the order of 1°C.  The
variation in the red excess power traces are between 0.05 and 0.1 W indicating a temperature variation of
about 1°C.  As noted in Section 3, the temperature algorithm of the Rigol DAC instrument that converted
the mV thermocouple output to temperature did not use a correct reference junction definition.  It is
speculated that the periodicity observed in the excess power curves is due to the changing room temperature
that resulted in error in the inferred temperature and hence inferred power.  In any case, the variation in the

Figure 4.7 Power, temperature, and pressure data from hydrogen (cell 1) and nitrogen (cell 2) cells.

14
excess power is at most 100 mW or 10% of the excess power.  This variation is removed by the subtraction
of N2 cell excess power, reducing the H2 cell excess power as discussed below.
A more troubling observation is the 100 to 200 mW of inferred excess power from the nitrogen cell shown
in the lower graph.  This cell is the control experiment where no excess heat is expected.  If we assume that
excess heat is the systematic error in the experiment, then a conservation approach is to subtract this value
from the excess heat registered in the hydrogen cell.  The result of this subtraction is shown by the dashed
green trace in the cell 1 graph.  This reduces the inferred excess heat in the hydrogen from 1 W to 0.8W up
to about 950 hours and to 0.7W thereafter.  Using this adjusted power, 6.3% more power is measured than
is input.
However, note that the pressure during these measurements is 1.24, about 20% higher than the pressure in
the cells during the pressure calibration.  If the 1-bar calibration data points for cell 2 are adjusted for this
higher pressure and refit to create a 1.2-bar cell 2 algorithm [see Appendix E] and this algorithm is used to
calculate the excess power in the nitrogen cell, the solid red trace in the lower graph results.  This line,
except for the periodic temperature error, lies near zero excess power.  Using this line to adjust the hydrogen
excess power curve downward an excess power of 1 W up to about 950 hours and to 0.9 W thereafter is
obtained.  Using this adjusted power, 7.5% more power is measured than is input.  This latter correction is
judged to be the most accurate. To a much lesser extent, a variable scaling correction should be applied to
the cell 1 excess power trace between 280 hours and 500 hours.
Power to cell 1 was reduced by 0.1 W in two steps at 885 and 935 hours, which reduced the temperature of
the cell interior 2°C, dropping the excess power by 100 mW.  Commanding a power increase at 1180 hours
to 13.0 W (0.3W above the previous 12.7W) raised the temperature to 297°C but recovers only 40 mW of
this lost 100 mW of excess power.  The same 300 mW increase in cell 2 did not similarly affect its excess
heat traces.  Returning the input power to cell 1 at 1275 hours created a large decrease in excess power as
discussed below.
The time integration of the solid (dark) green excess power trace in the upper graph yields the excess energy.
This integration was performed from 280 hours to 1275 hours and then normalized by the mass of the
sample to yield a value of specific energy.  Normalizing to the 20 gram mass of the ZrO2NiPd sample yields
a specific energy of 173 MJ/kg whereas assuming that the active element is the 5.44g of Ni+Pd [Appendix
F] yields a specific energy of 635 MJ/kg.  Normalized to the Pd would yield a specific energy 10x that of
the Ni specific energy value.  For comparison, methane fuel has a specific energy of 55.5 MJ/kg, the highest
value for any hydrocarbon fuel; hydrogen compressed to a pressure of 700 bar has a value of 142 MJ/kg,
the highest value for any chemical fuel. [17] These chemical values are somewhat arbitrary as they require
an oxidizer, which is not included in the mass.
4.5 Power Down Period
The termination sequence of the experiment began after 1275 hours and is shown in Figure 4.8.  This time
was chosen for practical considerations and not due to any observed abatement of excess power.  This
sequence was complete at 1610 hours, a period of 14 days.  The traces in these graphs are the same as those
identified in Figure 4.7.
It is immediately apparent that the excess power traces in the hydrogen (upper) graph are noisy.  This
problem began as the power to the cell was reduced.  This may be due to a malfunction in the regulated
output of the hydrogen cell power supply as can be seen in the blue power trace.  Even with this noisy data,
it is clear that a small (12°C) change in temperature decreases the excess power by nearly a factor of 2.
Increasing the temperature 5°C at 1326 hours did not increase the excess power. Stepping down in input
power and temperature produces a credible decrease in excess power (solid green trace) as calculated by
subtracting the scaled N2 excess power.  The last temperature step decrease of 150oC reduced the excess
power of 180 mW to zero at room temperature.

15
The data at temperatures 23°C <T ≤ 250oC in the nitrogen (lower) graph produce negative excess powers
(solid red trace).  The -300 mW value at 1525 hours is too large to be ascribed to a pressure-induced error
in the calibration curve or measurement error in the input power.  It is more likely due to a temperature
lower than that anticipated by the calibration curve; i.e., a cooling not accounted for in the calibration
measurements.  However, at room temperature, the algorithm does produce zero excess power. During this
final interval, the room temperature increases 1°C and in the final temperature step the nitrogen pressure
drops 20%.  The scaled 1.2 bar calibration curve is used throughout all these intervals.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
A shortcoming of this work is the method chosen to measure the power generated by the sample.  Power
was inferred from a temperature measured by thermocouples imbedded in the sample.  This inference was
made using algorithms generated by applying known powers to the fully configured sample chamber and
measuring the resultant temperature from a thermocouple.  It is prudent to quantitatively examine the error
in this method.
Sources of error in measuring the excess power using this method include:
1. Inaccurate input power measurements.
2. Systematic errors in the thermocouple temperature measurement.
a. Reference junction error.
b. Error due to temperature gradient in sample.
c. Exothermic or endothermic chemical reaction between thermocouple and the sample/gas.
3. Errors of the calibration algorithm.
a. Uncorrected variation with pressure.
b. Uncorrected variation with temperature
c. Variation of thermal conductivity with gas composition.
d. Time constant errors.
Error in the excess power measurement due to items 1 and 2 are estimated by an error propagation
calculation.  Assuming that the principal source of error is temperature, we can estimate the error in the
power. If the power, P, as a function of temperature, T, is given by Eq. 1 in Section 4.1. then error in the
power, 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃, is [18]
𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃 = 𝜎𝜎𝑇𝑇 �
𝜕𝜕𝑃𝑃
𝜕𝜕𝑇𝑇
�        (2)
or
𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃 = 𝜎𝜎𝑇𝑇(3𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇2 + 2𝑏𝑏𝑇𝑇 + 𝑐𝑐)      (3)
where 𝑎𝑎, b, and c are the coefficients of the cubic, quadratic, and linear terms in Eq. 1.
For T = 300°C, taking the coefficients from the hydrogen vacuum fit and estimating the temperature error
to be 0.5°C, we find propagated error in the inferred power in the hydrogen cell is 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃𝐻𝐻2  = 0.049 W.
The excess power is Pex = PH2 –Pin so
𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
2 = 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡
2 + 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
2       (4)
Accordingly, 𝜎𝜎𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 0.049 W for a 10 mW error in the measured input power (the measured error in the
input is less than half this assumed value).  For an excess power of 1 W, this is an absolute error of 5% in
the power and the integrated excess energy.
Regarding error 2c, type K thermocouples have a well-known inaccuracy if operated in a reducing (i.e.,
hydrogen) atmosphere.  The hydrogen chemically reacts with the thermocouple metals resulting in what
has been dubbed “green rot.”  However, this phenomenon only occurs at temperature above 800°C and
results in temperature readings lower than actual (for example, see Ref. [20]). The maximum temperature
used in this work was near 300°C and if even this were an issue the result would be an underestimate of the
measured excess energy.

17
Systematic errors in 3a and 3b were considered in the data processing as discussed in Section 4.4.  These
errors are judged to be on the order of 0.05 W based on the renormalized curve of the nitrogen cell. In the
analysis the excess power is reduced by this amount to conservatively account for this error.  Item 3c could
be a concern as the cell calibrations were done with nitrogen and the thermal conductivity of nitrogen gas
and hydrogen gas differ by a factor of nearly seven at high temperatures (see Appendix C and Ref. [19]).
However, since the 0 bar pressure calibration was used for the calculation of the power in the hydrogen
cell, this is not an issue.  In the future it may be prudent to use helium (which has a thermal conductivity
closer to that of H2, see Appendix C) for the calibration and in the reference cell.
Even if the power is inferred from the temperature exactly, all sources of mechanical and chemical energy
sources must be understood before an anomalous value (if any) can be assigned.  Other sources of energy:
• PV work in pressurizing the cell
• Heat adsorption exothermic energy released
These sources were discussed in Section 4.2 and are not significant.
In summary, for the 950 hour (40 day) integration period: N2 cell excess energy is 0.12 MJ; the difference
between the hydrogen cell and nitrogen cell excess energy is 3.5 MJ (±5%).  The H2 cell excess power (less
N2 excess power) was 7.5% of input power.  The H2 cell specific energy (less the N2 excess energy) = 173
MJ/kg (20 gm ZrO2NiPd) or H2 cell specific energy (N2 corrected) = 635 MJ/kg (5.4gm NiPd).  For
reference, methane (hydrocarbon fuel with highest specific energy) = 55.5 MJ/kg, and H2 highly
compressed to 700 bar (highest known chemical specific energy) = 142 MJ/kg.
For the 300-hour power down sequence the H2 cell excess power traces values appear credible. There is
some evidence of excess power abatement.  The low temperature N2-cell excess-power traces are not
completely understood.
The results presented here indicate a source of heat energy was measured that is not chemical in origin.

This measurement and conclusion are in general agreement with those of Arata and Zhang [4] and Ahern
[5]. Given the importance a source of high specific energy has for space technology, this work indicates
that additional research should be pursued.  If future work is better funded, calorimetry should be used
instead of thermometry to measure the heat power.

Appendix A. The First Experiment Trial
This first trial served primarily as a learning vehicle for developing and testing an experimental protocol.
A secondary objective was the observation of excess heat of non-chemical origin.  A tertiary goal was to
see the effect, if any, of magnetic particles in the active material (see Appendix B).  Thus the two cells in
this experiment were identical except for the addition of magnetic particles in the second cell. The desired
test plan for first run comprised seven steps.
1. Load 10 grams of 1 – 3 micron ZrO2NiPd powder to be tested in cell 1.
2. Load 10 grams of 1 – 3 micron ZrO2NiPd powder mixed with 10 gm of SmCo powder in cell 2.
3. Vacuum bake both cells at 390°C for 35 hours to remove water.
4. Pressurize cells 1 and 2 in parallel with D2 at 7 bar (100 psia) at 22°C to load micro-powder with
deuterium. After pressure drops, recharge with D2 until fully loaded (up to 10X in an hour).
5. Equalized D2 pressure in both cells.
6. Heat cells individually to 280°C recording four temperatures, pressures, input power.
7. Record data at 30s intervals for duration of experiment (days/weeks).

This desired protocol could not be followed due to
an unusual pressure response during the first D2
loading.  This led to the vacuum bakeout being done
twice at higher than the desired temperature and to
an anomalous pressure behavior during the loading
of the D2 gas.
The time sequence used is given in Figures A.1 and
A.3. Samples were loaded into the two cells and
baked at 430°C for 60+ hours to remove H2O as
shown in Figure A.1.  Previous studies indicate that a bakeout at 390°C for 35 hours was shown to be
sufficient to eliminate heat from H/D exchange reactions from light water (H2O) trapped in the samples.
[21] The calibration data were then acquired by raising the samples from room temperature (23°C) to 430°C
in five steps, recording the input power to each cell with the cells under vacuum.  The resulting data were
fit to a third order polynomial to create algorithms to be used to infer the power from a temperature
measurement.  Subsequently the cells were elevated in temperature to check that the inferred power from

the temperature measured equaled the input power.  This check was done both with the cell under vacuum
and pressured with about 0.5 bar (400 Torr) of N2.  The calibration curves are given in Figure A.2.  Note
that the cell response is approximately 8.5°C per Watt of input power.  Performing the calibration with the
cells in the exact configuration (mass, thermocouple placement, etc.) was judged as the most reliable
method to infer power from temperature.
Subsequently, the cells were evacuated and filled with 2.5 bar (36 psia) of D2.  The pressure initially dropped
to 2.3 bar (33 psia) during the first hour but the pressure increased to 3.0 bar (43 psia) overnight.  After this
puzzling behavior it was decided to evacuate the cells again and bake them overnight at 225°C.  After the
overnight bakeout, the cells were cooled to room temperature and pressurized with 2.5 bar (36 psia) of
deuterium.  After 4 hours, the pressure was reduced to about 1 bar and power was applied to bring the
temperature of the cells to near 280°C, thus beginning the experiment.

Figure A.3 First 100 hours of first experiment showing excess power, power in, temperature and pressure.
Figure A.3 shows the first 100 hours of the experimental run.  This figure highlights the second bakeout
and D2 gas fill and the initial heating of the cell designed to trigger the reaction.  In this plot there are four
data traces; each are read on the left axis with the scaling factors given in the figure legend.  The top graph
displays the data from cell 1 that contained only the ZrO2NiPd material; the bottom graph plots the data
from cell 2, which contains the identical material as that in cell 1 plus the magnetic particles.   The heavy

21
blue curve is the power input to the cell divided by 10.  Note that the power supplies are operated in constant
voltage mode with same voltage going to each cell.  Because of a small difference in the length of the heater
wires, the power is slightly different for the two cells for the same input voltage.  The temperature in Celsius
divided by 200 is given by the dashed pink line.  Pressure of the deuterium gas in PSIA divided by 22 is
given the blue-green dashed line.  Finally, the excess power is plotted using a solid red line.  This power is
the difference between the power inferred from the measured temperature using the calibration curve
(Figure A.2) and the input power.
It is interesting to note the behavior of the pressure.  In cell 1, after lowering the pressure to about 1.2 bar
(18 psia) and closing the cell valve, the pressure decreases for about 10 hours as the cell is heated to 350°C
to a constant value of about 0.4 bar (6 psia).  The behavior of the D2 pressure in cell 2 is quite different.  It
was closed at a similar starting pressure but it decreased to near zero over a much greater time (>200 hours
as can be seen in Figure A.4).  It is not known whether the different pressure behavior between the two cells
is due to a leak in the vacuum jacket in cell 2 or the characteristics of the SmCo particles.
Figure A.4 shows the entire data set from experiment 1, a period of 550 hours or nearly 23 days.  All data
traces are the same as those identified in Figure A.3.  The heating of the cells to trigger the reaction began
at hour 31.5.  The large “spikes” in the excess power curves occur whenever the power supplied to the cell
is changed and are due to the time required for the cell to reach the equilibrium temperature used in the
calibration function.  These excursions are positive when increasing the power to the cells and negative
when decreasing the power to the cells.  The excess power is correct only after equilibrium is reached.  All
changes to the input power were made at the same time with identical voltages applied to the heater coils.
The total excess energy is calculated by integrating the excess power curve with time starting at hour 33.6.
There are obvious and significant differences in the excess power curves between the two cells.  First, the
time response is much faster in cell 1.  This is likely to due to the smaller thermal mass of the sample in
cell 1 and possibly to different thermocouple placement in the two cells.  If the thermocouple were touching
the interior stainless steel wall of cell 2, the temperature variations would be much slower than that of cell
1 if the cell 1 thermocouple were isolated in the sample.  Although this would affect the time to equilibrium
it should not affect the inferred power because it would be in the same position during the calibrations runs.
Second, the excess power was significantly greater in the cell with the magnetic particles.  The integrated
specific excess energy for cell 1 (assuming the relevant mass is 10 grams) is 21 MJ/kg whereas for cell 2 it
is 69 MJ/kg.  Note that if the relevant mass is considered just the nickel and palladium then the specific
energy is about three times these values. As noted in Section 4, the most energy dense hydrocarbon is
methane at 55.5 MJ/kg.  [17]
The most interesting difference between the two cells is the behavior of the excess energy as the temperature
is lowered at 330 hours into the run.  For most of the experiment the cell temperature was held near a
temperature of 300°C.  For cell 1, no significant change in the excess power was observed when the
temperature was lowered from 300oC to 225°C in three steps.  However, in cell 2, the excess power
increased for each of these steps.  When the temperature was lowered to 130°C, the excess power in cell 1
decreased to near 0 whereas the excess power in cell 2 increased to its highest value.  Lowering the
temperature to 50°C, the excess power in cell 2 was still 0.25 W.  At room temperature, excess power of
both cells was zero.  For cell 1, the power always decreased with decreasing temperature and was zero at
130°C.  For all these experiments the maximum excess power was 0.6 W (a temperature change of 5°C) in
cell 2 while heating with 6.3 W.  For the case of the magnet-mixture, the excess power continued until the
temperature was lowered to room temperature, a period of about 18 days.

Figure A.4.  Entire data set from first experiment.
As previously mentioned, several investigators have noted increased excess energy in the presence of a
magnetic field (for example, see Ref. [6]).  These data tentatively support those observations.  The increase
in excess energy as the temperature is lowered may be due to an increasing magnetic field as the temperature
is lowered, as discussed in Appendix B.  However, based on the measurements presented in Appendix B,
only an increase of about 15% in the magnetic field is expected by lowering the temperature from 300°C
to 23°C.
The observation of excess heat in this first experiment was encouraging.  However, the data cannot be
considered definitive.  Major short comings include data taken at a pressure different than used to generate
the calibration curves; bare thermocouples that chemically react with test materials; and unknown positions
of the thermocouples in the cells (touching walls or not in contact with test material).  These shortcomings
were corrected in the second experiment.  Based on this work, the following changes were made for the
principal experimental trial:
• Better thermally isolated cells with less heat capacity and welded internal fittings were used.
• Sample was baked out below 350°C.
• Two interior thermocouples were used.

23
• The interior thermocouples were shielded from the sample material.
• A manual readout gauge with 0-70 psia (5 bar) range was installed.
• 0-285 psia (20 bar) pressure transducers were replaced with 0-90 psia (6 bar) transducers.
• The mass of the active material in each cell was increased to 20 grams and enough magnetic
particles (6 grams of SmCo) to fill the remainder of the cell volume.
• Samples were ground to < 1 micron diameter.
• H2 gas was used instead of D2.
• Real-time temperature and pressure digital readouts were written into DAQ software.
• Excess power plot was added to DAQ real-time graph.
• X-ray tomography was used to observe the cell packing and thermocouple positions.

Appendix B. Germaine Properties of Rare Earth Magnets
There have been many reports of evidence that a magnetic field can enhance the AHE.  Perhaps the most
quantitative, available, and relevant to NiPd nanoparticles in a ZrO2 matrix is Ref. [6]. To explore this, the
second cell was filled with a mixture of approximately equal weights of a milled SmCo 2-17 magnet and
the ZrO2NiPd sample described above.
Although the magnetic field strength of NdFeB magnets is higher than that of SmCo 2-17 magnets, the
working temperature of the SmCo magnets is higher than that of the Nd magnets.  The working temperature
for most NdFeB magnets is usually below 150o C (even though the Curie temperature is much higher). The
magnetic field decreases above the working temperature.  Furthermore, NdFeB magnets oxide quickly and
usually are coated with Nickle or Tin. The oxidized particles have diminished magnetic properties.  At the
temperatures above 150°C, 2Sm-17Co magnets usually will have a higher magnetic field than NdFeB
magnets. A comparison of the B-field strength of SmCo and NdFe magnets taken from the supplier’s
catalogue is shown in Figure B.1, indicating a superior performance of the SmCo magnet with increasing
temperature.

However, measuring the performance of this
magnet in our laboratory found the maximum B-
field at the surface of the magnet to be 2600 gauss
and that it decreased to 1650 gauss at 450°C, a drop
of about 35% (Figure B.3).  Cooling the magnet to
room temperature, the surface field returned only to
2000 gauss also shown in Figure B.3.  Reheating the
magnetic to 450°C, the field again reduced to 1650
gauss, a drop of 17%.

Appendix F. Calculation of Elemental Mass of the Principal Experimental Trial
As noted in section 2, the base metallic material, was prepared by Ames Laboratory [7] by arc melting a
90 gram mixture of 65wt% Zr 32wt% Ni 3wt% Pd using 99.95% purity elements.  These were delivered
in a series of nine envelopes, each marked with the mass of the metal used to charge the ribbon fabricator
instrument.  After receiving, the ribbon in each envelop was weighted.  The results for the samples used
in the principal experimental trial are given in Table F.1
Table F1 Ribbon Mass
Envelope Charge Mass (g) Ribbon Mass (g)
5 9.38 8.745
6 9.59 8.930
7 9.07 4.385
8 8.49 3.850
8+7 Wheel Material -- 8.190

The total of this ribbon material = 34.10 g and was placed in a furnace and heated at 440oC for 28 hours
creating a ZrO2 matrix imbedded with nanometer sized islands of Ni and Pd [5].  This brittle material was
ground in a mortar and pestle and passed through a No. 35 mesh (0.5 mm).  The mesh separated the
ductile ribbon which did not grind from the oxide.  Both components were weighted yielding 43.65 g of
oxide and 0.20 g of ribbon.  Therefore the masses of the metallic elements in the oxide can be calculated
from the ribbon material in the oxide; i.e., 34.1g – 0.20g = 33.90g:
Metal in Oxide:  0.65 x 33.90g Zr;  0.32 x 33.90g Ni;  0.03 x 33.90g Pd;
= 22.03g Zr;              10.85g Ni               1.02 g Pd.
Thus the oxygen mass is 43.65g – 33.90g = 9.75g and the percentages of the materials in the oxide are
given in Table F.2

Six grams of SmCo particles were added to the 20 g sample of oxide material in each cell.  The total of
the Ni and Pd active metal is 5.44 g.  The mole ratio of Ni:Pd is 19.6:1.

Appendix G. Calculation of H2 Exothermic Loading Energy
The energy produced during hydrogen loading is calculated by converting the temperature rise to power
using the 1 bar calibration curve for cell 1 shown in Figure 4.5 and integrating that power over time (see
Figure G.1).  Assuming that 100 kJ/mole of energy is released when absorbed by Pd [14] implies 0.011
moles of H2 are absorbed by Pd.

where C = 7.6 x 10-5 K m/N and the pressure parameter is given by 𝑃𝑃𝑝𝑝 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃/𝑇𝑇. Here, P is the pressure
(N/m2 = Pa), d is the scale length (m), and T is the temperature (K).  A plot of this equation is given in
Figure I.1 While this formula essentially describes Low Pressure Theory only (the so-called Slip Flow
Theory) and should be replaced by the Free Molecule Theory when the pressure parameter falls below 10-4,
the formula gives remarkably good results for much lower values. [20]

Figure I.1 Conductivity Ratio as a function of the pressure parameter from [20].
A well-maintained two-stage mechanical pump can reduce the pressure to 1 mT (= 0.1 Pa). However, the
pump available to evacuate the jacket surrounding the test cell created a reduced pressure of only 5 Pa (40
mT).  For a 1 cm scale length, this reduced the thermal conductivity of the air by only 30%, whereas a
well-maintained two-stage rotary vane pump would have reduced by thermal conductivity of air factor of
24 from the atmospheric pressure value.
