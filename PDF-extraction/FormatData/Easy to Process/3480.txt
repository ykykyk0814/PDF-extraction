In recent papers (1, 2, 3, 4) the author has deduced from experiments with tritium (5) that during
heating of a TiT0.0035 -preparation and of a TiT0.035-preparation the radioactivity of the tritium
decreased strongly. This strange effect was distinctly confirmed by the observation that with the
TiT0.035-preparation the radioactivity decreased 12.5 times stronger than the release of tritium
(2,3,4). A quite independent proof of the strong decrease of λ of tritium could be obtained by a
thermodynamic evaluation of the heating experiment with the TiT0.0035-preparation: Assuming
that λ of tritium decreases to zero or nearly zero in a part of the tritons enables the determination
of the number of tritons with normal λ, nT and the number of tritons with λ ≈ 0 nTo, both as a
function of temperature. Then quite surprising nT and nTo follow the laws of chemical equilibria
in distinct parts of the experimental A = f(T)-function. From this unexpected result the decrease
of tritium radioactivity is definitely proved once again (6).
All these experiments are performed with titanium preparations obtained by evaporation of the
metal in argon at a suitable gas pressure, e.g. 0.2 to 2.5 cm of mercury. A comprehensive
description of the evaporation procedure is given in Ref. 3. Fig. 1 shows an electron micrograph
(5) of a preparation as used in our experiments. Further electron micrographs of such
preparations are displayed in Fig. 2 of Ref. 7 and Fig. 1 of Ref. 8. The preparation consists of
small (dia. ≈ 15 nm) monocrystalline Ti-particles which are arranged in chains. I assume that
these properties or one or two of them are necessary conditions for the decrease of tritium

radioactivity. This assumption is confirmed by the observation, that a decrease of tritium
radioactivity is never observed with Ti-preparations which are generally used for storage of
tritium (9). Such preparations dont have the above stated properties. They consist of single and
big non monocrystalline Ti-particles, in my experience.
The arrangement of our Ti-particles in chains with many ramifications results in a very open
structure of our preparation. There is much empty space between the Ti-particles of different
chains. The time constant for the uptake of tritium is about 10 seconds (stated in thousands of
experiments for technological applications). This ensures that the tritium is absorbed to an equal
concentration by the different Ti-particles (maximum of entropy).
There is a strong suspicion that cold DD-fusion (10) and decrease of tritium radioactivity are
caused by the same or a related fundamental principle (2, p. 171). A decrease of tritium
radioactivity was obtained with Ti-preparations which are described in full length earlier. I
propose thus a cold fusion experiment applying the same preparation with which decrease of
tritium radioactivity was obtained:
Prepare a same Ti-preparation by evaporation of the metal in argon (3) as done in our heating
experiments. Absorb deuterium in this preparation to obtain TiD0.5 to get hydride phase (6).
Slowly increase the temperature of the preparation to several hundred degrees centigrade as
done in our heating experiments (see e.g. 3). Measure the fast neutron emission as a function of
temperature. It is most interesting if the same or a similar dependence of neutron emission from
temperature is obtained as with the decrease of tritium radioactivity. Experiments with different
deuterium concentrations are recommended to arrive to a theoretical explanation of the effect
(6).
