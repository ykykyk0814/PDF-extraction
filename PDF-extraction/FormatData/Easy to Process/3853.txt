Abstract
A new electrolytic protocol is proposed, capable of insuring a very high Hydrogen loading of
thin Palladium wires. The main characteristic of the procedure consists in the use of a particular
electrolyte containing very small amounts of alkaline-earth metals dissolved in a diiuted acid
solution (H20+HCl).
The addition of alkaline-earth metals to the electrolyte appears to be decisive for the
achievement of HlPd loading ratios close to 1. Two independent Research Groups have tested the
protocol with similar results.
Probably because of the presence of contaminants in the heavy water, less satisfactory results
have been obtained for the DlPd loading ratios (best result: RlRo = 1.52; DlPd ;: 0.97)

Introduction
It is generally known that in cold fusion experiments, in order to obtain stable and reproducible
excess heat it is necessary to achieve and maintain very high DlPd (» 0.85) loading ratios [Ref. I].
The poor results, especially from the point of view of their reproducibility, generally achieved
by the conventional electrolytic techniques, based on the use of LiOH solutions, induced us to
develop a completely different approach.
In order to increase the cathodic overvoltage, which is known to be the main controlling.
parameter of the H(D) Pd loading, we tried to modify the nature of the cathode, by inducing the
formation of a very thin layer of an alkaline-earth carbonate on its surface [Ref. 2].
After the fust encouraging results, we decided to carry out a systematic work, starting with
light water, in order to define the best composition of the electrolyte and the most effective loading
procedure.
With reference to the paper presented by Celani et al. [Ref. 3], which is substantially a
comprehensive panorama over all the activities carried out by our group in the last two years, the
present one shows in detail the most significant results of the experimental work.
Experimental Apparatus
A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in Figure 1. The electrolytic cell
consists of a Pd cathode (a thin wire - diameter 50 IlIll - length 19 cm), a Pt anode of the same
length (diameter 200 1lIll) set at a distance of 1.5 - 2 cm form the cathode, both plunged iIi a glass
191
beaker filled with about 400 m1 of H20+HCI solution. The cell is placed into a two litre water bath
in order to reduce the temperature fluctuations around the room temperature (usually kept at 22°C).
Cell, bath and room temperatures are continuously monitored and recorded.
The power supply can operate as a constant D.C. current generator or, optionally, as a constant
D.C. voltage generator. The cathode is grounded. The voltage is applied to the anode electrode
through a home-made impedance adapter circuit (impedance booster), in order to avoid a current
feed-back from the A.C. measuring circuit. The latter is essentially composed by a pulse generator
(having sinusoidal, square and triangular wave selection) and a ground home-made coupling circuit
(ground return, both for the D.C. and A.c. generators):
The D.C. generator can be applied to the edge points A or B of the anode whereas the A.C.
generator can be applied to the edge points C or G of the cathode. The Pd wire voltage pick-ups
C,D,E,F,G allow for the measurements of the resistances of the correspondent wire segments (CD=
bottom, DE=down, EF=up, FG=top). In the present work the length of the CD and FG segments has
been set to 0, so that in the following, reference will be made to only two segments, i.e. DE=
"down" and EF= "up", both of length 9.5 cm.
The loading ratio is inferred by means of the well known relationship [Ref.s 4,5,6] between
resistance and H(D) content in the Pd matrix (Fig. 2) and continuously monitored.
The Pd cathode, because of its favourable surface/volume ratio, allows for a faster Hydrogen
absorption and its high resistivity improves both the accuracy and the precision of the
measurements. Furthermore, the lIr dependence of the electric field around the wire allows for a
sharp increase of the pH value just in its proximity, thus promoting the carbonate precipitation in
that region only (see after).
Composition of the electrolyte
The set of experiments which led us to the fmal choice of the electrolyte composition is
extensively described in Reference 2. Here only the essentials will be treated.
It is known that Hydrogen can enter a metal only if it is present on its surface in the form of H
atoms. In the case of the electrolytic Hydrogen loading of a Pd cathode, after the first rapid
absorption (absorption isotherm - a+13 phase), the Hydrogen loading progressively slows down
until it comes to an end, no matter how much is the applied current density. TItis is mainly due to
the catalytic properties of the Pd surface. In fact, even though Hydrogen atoms are continuously
formed at the Pd cathode during the electrolysis, they rapidly recombine to form the Hydrogen
molecule, thus hindering the absorption process, (a fact consistent with the very low overvoltage
measured with Pd cathodes). It is also known that catalytic surfaces can be poisoned by films of

adsorbed or deposited substances. On the basis of this assumption we tried to alter the Pd surface
through the local precipitation of inorganic substances. The final choice has fallen upon alkaline
earth carbonates and among them Strontium carbonate.
The choice of the alkaline earth metals was dictated by the fact that they do not discharge to
form a metallic layer, which can eventually hinder the Hydrogen absorption due to the low
Hydrogen permeability typical of most metals. M ercury, for example, even though it effectively
poisons the Pd surface, is able to stop any Hydrogen exchange. We found it useful only as an
extremely thin layer, very hardly controllable through the concentration of Hg ions in the
electrolyte. Instead, because of its solubility product, the local precipitation of srCo3 is easily
controlled through Sr++ concentration, pH, and current density. Because of their higher solubility
product both CaC03 and BaC03 are less effective [Ref. 2u�]. The proper Sr++ concentration range is
within 30 to 70 �MIl. Sr++ is added as SrClz. By setting the pH at 4.5 with HCI additions, the proper
CO2 concentration is that one insured by maintaining the electrolyte exposed to open air.
192
Experimental
Effect of Sr++ additions
After a start-up procedure, common to all experiments, consisting in:
I) The Pd wire is Joule heated (SOO rnA) in air (up to roughly 600°C) in order to completely
eliminate occasional residual Hydrogen and to relax mechanical stresses due to the wire
cold-working.
2) The cell is filled with pure distilled water (400 cm3).
3) A small quantity of HCl is added till the pH of the solution is around 4.S (the required
amount is about 20 j..IM )
the electrolysis starts with the application of S rnA current. This current value is maintained until the
cathode reaches a first asymptotic loading value (Fig. 3). At this point the electrolysis current is
varied according to the following sequence:
Turned off (partial deloading) - turned on (high current loading till next asymptotic value) -
turned off (partial deloading)- Turned on (low current loading till next asymptotic value).
It will be referred to this sequence as to the off-high-off-low (OHOL) current sequence.
By repeating the sequence, the loading ratios HlPd tend to become higher until a final
asymptotic value is reached, subjected to no further improvement.
In order to point out the effectiveness of the Sr addition to the electrolyte a blank test has been
carried out by operating with an electrolyte containing only HC!.
In Figure 4, it is shown that the final maximum loading ratio RfRo obtained by the above described
procedure is "" I.SO.
At this point the current was turned off in order to allow for a complete deloading of the Pd cathode
(Fig. 4).
SrCl2 is then added (SO IlM) to the electrolyte and the electrolysis is started again with the
same set of conditions (S rnA). The OHOL sequence has then been applied and repeated until a
final asymptotic value of RfRo of US has been reached (Fig.s S, 6 and 7). Therefore it is proved
that the Sr addition is decisive for the achievement of extremely low RfRo values.
Substantially the same results have been obtained by substituting the cr ions with S04 - ones.
Effect of Hg ++ additions
Tests using HgCh at a concentration of ",, 100{; M (pH=4.S) have shown that a Hg coating forms
quickly, thus covering the Pd cathode and blocking the loading at around the peak (RlRo= 1.7S).
The block could not be removed even by strongly increasing the current or by repeatedly applying
the OHOL sequence.
Further tests [Ref. 7] carried out with remarkably lower HgCh concentrations (",, 10-8 M) have
shown a very slow loading (two days) up to a final asymptotic value of RlRo=1.3S. It was observed
that even by turning off the current, the deloading rate was extremely low, suggesting that even at
such a low concentration an impermeable Hg layer fmally forms on the Pd surface.
In another experiment (Fig. 8), to the Sr++ containing electrolyte, HgCl2 was added up to a
concentration of 10-5 M. A strong loading occurred (RlRo= 1. 10 and I. IS respectively for "up" and
"down" sectors). This suggests that Mercury could not form a continuous coating because of the
presence on the cathode surface of a previously precipitated srCo3 layer.
Thermal resistivity coefficient of the Pd-H cathode.
As described in an our previous works [Ref. 8], for the first time we measured the thennal
resistivity coefficient of the Pd cathode (aT), when RfRo= 1.2. Such a coefficient is known to
decrease as the H concentration in Pd increases between HlPd=O. 1 (ar 4.1. 10-3 KI) up to

H/Pd=O.7 (2.0.10.3 K·'), which is the maximum H concentration for which there were available data
[Ref 9]. The result of our measurements at RfRo=1.2 (H/Pd close to 1) is aT = 3.5.10.3 K'.
A further value of aT;: 6.0.10.3 K·' has been found at H/Pd a bit closer to 1 (RIRo = 1.15).
These results show that between H/Pd=O.7 and H/Pd '" 1, there must be a minimum value of aT,
probably rising rapidly in the H/Pd region close to 1. This strongly suggests that a new phase is
starting to nucleate inside the Pd-H 13 phase.
Finally, the existence of a change of phase seems to be indicated by the presence of a
characteristic shoulder (Fig. 4), which appears in the RIRo versus time deloading curve, just after
the peak has been overcome. The occurrence of the shoulder (roughly around H/Pd=0.65) after the
peak, might be connected with the end of 13 phase and the beginning of a+13 phase, sequentially
occurring during the deloading.
Preliminary Pd-D loading experiments
When our batch of commercial heavy water was used for preparing the electrolytic solution,
according to the above described protocol, the best loading obtained was DlPd=O.75. Taking into
account that our procedure requires the absence of any foreign substance in the electrolyte apart
from Sr++ ions and CO2, it will be clear that even the small amounts of impurities (inorganic,
organic and biologic materials) normally present into that commercial heavy water, could have
seriously impaired the proper formation of the thin layer ofSrC� on the Pd surface.
Another batch of guaranteed higher purity heavy water was employed and the composition of
the electrolyte was the same one used for H loading.
High purity heavy water is remarkably hygroscopic. Consequently, the electrolytic cell was
excluded from the contact with ambient air. The necessary supply of CO2 was assured by a flow of
air, dried by bubbling it into concentrated sulphuric acid, and subsequently into heavy water.
It is to be noted that with the experimental set-up used for D loading, both ends of the up and
down sectors of the Pd wires were protected with a drop of silicone sealant for a total length of
roughly 4 mm (about 4% of their length). These portions of the cathode are not in contact with the
electrolyte and cannot be directly loaded. In this conditions it was found that the maximum
numerical value of RIRo read by the instruments was 1.96 instead of 2.0. Therefore the values of
RIRo, reported in the Figures from 9 to 12 are about 2% lower than the correct ones.
In Figure 9 the effect of the OHOL sequence is shown with some detail. These results are
rather inferior if compared with the ones obtained with H loading.
After several attempts it was found effective to increase the deloading time during the off
portion of the OHOL sequence, allowing for an almost complete deloading. Some of the results are
shown in Figure 10. After several new OHOL sequence applications a final asymptotic value of
RIRo=1.62 (at 25°C) was achieved. The current was then increased up to 30 rnA. It can be seen
that an RIRo value of 1.55 was rapidly achieved. By lowering the applied current the RIRo value
rose to 1.65. By again increasing the current up to 90 rnA a RIRo value of 1.52 was obtained (Fig.
11). In the same figure it is shown that by turning the current off: the deloading process proceeds
regularly with a peak of RIRo at 1.95. It should be noted that the deloading rate of the D loaded
wire is significantly lower than that observed with the deloading of the H-Ioaded wire (Fig. 4). Such
a difference could be due to the difference between the length of the deloading time within the
OHOL sequence.
The previously reported "loading ramps" effect [Ref 10] has been observed to occur
sometimes when loading is quite high (RIRo< 1.75). We observed this effect to occur several times
especially in the "up" wire sector (Fig. 12), when RIRo decreases under 1.65 (cycles oscillating
between 1.643 and 1.647, with a period roughly of 1 hour, even lasting for about I day and
disappearing when RIRo rises up over 1.66).
In a previous paper [Ref II], we conjectured that this effect could be located within just a few
small fractions of the wire achieving very high loading (RIRo< 1.5), thus giving rise to "bursts" of

Conclusions

In conclusion a protocol for the obtainment of high H/Pd and D/Pd values has been
developed, in agreement with the hypothesis of a modification of the catalytic properties of the Pd­
cathode surface, through the formation of thin layers of srCo3, by local precipitation due to pH
increase at the cathode surface.
The Pd-H loading protocol has been tested by Pirelli-Cavi SpA Research Laboratory (Milan),
by Dr D. Garbelli Group (under the supervision of Ing. F. Fontana) and the Stanford Research
Institute (CA), by Dr P. Tripodi Group (under the direction of Dr M. McKubre) and was found to
be effective. In particular by the PireIli Group has shown detailed evidence of the deposited layer on
the Pd surface through the use of a SEM apparatus (as it is reported by Dr Garbelli at this same
Congress).
