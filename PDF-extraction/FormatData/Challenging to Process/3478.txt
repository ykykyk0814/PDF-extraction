I. INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of radioactivity. many attempts
have been made to change the radioactive decay con­
stant 11. by varying extranuclear conditions. 12 Many half­
l ife changes. e.g .. of electron capture and of internal
conversion. by altering the chemical environment have
been reported. In this context. experiments with tritium
to be used for technological appl ications3-6 performed at
Phil ips Research Laboratories may be of interest. These
experiments point  to a sharp decrease in the radioactiv­
i ty of tri tium when tri tium was incorporated into small
particles of titanium.
In  a recent l etter.7 the author gave a short description
and preliminary interpretation of the experiments as a first
attempt to explain the effect i n  terms of a "nuclear pair
hypothesis." This paper gives a more detai l ed descrip­
tion and interpretation of these and additional experi­
ments, which resul ts in a high degree of evidence for
the strange effect of the decrease of tritium radioactivity.

II. EXPERIMENTAL
Figures I and 2 show the main setups used in the
experiments. A mercury-diffusion pump with one or two
l iquid air traps was used i n  the vacuum i nstallations. The
temperature of the l aboratory room was stabil ized within
1 °C, To ensure that as many i mpurities as possible were
el iminated. we careful ly degassed the vacuum installa­
tion, the tube, and the evaporator at the highest possible
temperature. After this procedure, the pressure was -IO-h
mm of mercury. The titanium preparation was made by
evaporation of the metal i n  argon at a suitable pressure.
e.g . . I to 2 cm of mercury.3A.12-15 Spectroscopical ly  pure
argon was always used. The titanium was deposited on
the inner wall of the vessel as a kind of soot. Examina­
tion by electron microscopy showed that the preparation
consisted of extremely small particles � IO to 20 nm in
diameter (dependent especial ly  on the argon pressure and
the evaporation rate) that were arranged in chains and
occasional ly  exh ibited ramification. Electron diffraction
indicated single crystallinity of the particles. Figure .2 of
Ref. 3 and Fig. I of R ef. 4 show electron micrographs
of such preparations. After pumping out the argon. the
tri tium was added and was rapid ly absorbed by the ti ta­
nium preparation at room temperature. A typical time con­
stant for the uptake of tri tium into the alpha phase of
titanium was � IO s. This has been stated in thousands of
experiments for technological applications. Our titanium
preparations were very active for the uptake of tritium at
room temperature because of their l arge surfaces. The
'He residue originating from the beta decay of the tri ­
tium was then removed by the vacuum pump.

In one part of the experiments. the beta electrons emit­
ted from the TiT, layer were measured via a cylindrical
electrode by a vibrating reed electrometer (Fig. I). The
preamplifier containing the vibrating reed was con­
nected to the TiT, tube by a conductor held by sapphire
supports. The negative voltage on the gold electrode
where the titanium preparation was deposited was cho­
sen in such a way that the I = f( U) curve was nearly
horizontal. In several other experiments, and especially
in the heating experiments described in this paper, there
was a thin nickel or steel window to enable measurement
of the X radiation accompanying the beta decay of the
tritium (internal and external bremsstrahlung and char­
acteristic X rays) by a Geiger-Muller (GM) tube (Figs. 2
and 3; the specifications of the GM tube were as follows:
a 19.8-mm-diam mica window, 2.5 to 3.5 mgicm2, and a
6.0- to 20-keV energy range). Of course, both experi­
ments gave only a relative measure of the radioactivity,
but we were especially interested in changes of the ra­
dioactive decay constant. Furthermore, we assumed in
most experiments a "normal" emission at the beginning
when the concentration of tritium in the TiT, experi­
ments was very small or when the temperature in the heat­
ing experiments was low.

relatively large heat capacity because of the steel flanges
by which a stainless steel foil was pressed vacuum tight
between copper rings. In the tube of Fig. 2, a nickel foil
was soldered to a covar pipe; this construction resulted
in a relatively low heat capacity.
The generation of bremsstrahlung of tritium beta elec­
trons was investigated by Budick et al.16 Furthermore,
characteristic X radiation of titanium and of the walls of
the tube was generated. but it was almost completely ab­
sorbed by the metal sheets between the preparation and
the GM tube present during the experiments. If the ge­
ometry of the TiT, preparation was unchanged, the radi­
ation intensity measured by the GM tube was proportional
to the total radioactivity of the tritium. The GM counting
arrangement was checked before and after each experi­
ment to ensure that the reading was proportional to the
radiation intensity. For future experiments. it is recom­
mended that modem detectors that enable determination
of the detailed X-ray spectrum be used. This will give
more information about the reliability of the measure­
ments and facilitate interpretation.
An analysis of the methods used to measure the ra­
dioactivity is given in Ref. 7; this is omitted in the present
paper.
In some experiments (the heating experiments), the
evaporator consisted of a tungsten wire on which several
pieces of titanium (each 7 mg) were fixed. The loss of
titanium, mainly due to alloying with the tungsten wire,
was -15%. In other experiments (the TiT, experiments).
an improved evaporator was used, which Ref. 4 de­
scribes in detail. The evaporator consisted of a 0.3-mm­
thick tungsten core wire on which a titanium and a

side by side. This evaporator design has the big advan­
tage of al l owing a check to be kept on the evaporation
process; this is done by observing changes in the resis­
tance of the evaporator. If  the evaporation power is kept
constant, one obtains an approximately constant evapo­
ration rate, and -d(l2)ldt (/ current through the evapo­
rator) is proportional to this rate. Then a nearly uniform
size of the titanium particles can be obtained if one uses
only that part of the evaporation process where d(fz)ldt
is constant. The loss of titanium due to al loying w i th the
tungsten is higher with the i mproved evaporator than with
the first described design because of the larger tungsten
surface exposed to the molten titanium. I t  is - 25%.
In the h eating experi ments, the tri tium was directly
introduced i nto the titanium preparation from a small bot­
tle that we obtained from the supplier. Table I gives the
analysis of a typical batch of tritium.
In the TiT, experiments. the tritium was first ab­
sorbed in a pressure regulator-l and then l ed into the tri­
tium distribution system consisting of cal ibrated volumes.
This procedure ensured that onl y  hydrogen isotopes were
added to the titanium preparation.

III. HEATING EXPERIMENTS
In one technical application. tritium was used as a
priming agent for gas discharge tubes," To this end. tri­
ti um was absorbed in a finely divided titanium prepara­
tion. as described earlier. and then a suspension was made
by u l trasonic treatment in a suitable suspension medium,
e.g . .  butyl acetate with I % nitrocellu lose. For the appl i ­
cation as a priming agent, a smal l part of the suspension
was painted at a suitable place in the gas d ischarge tube.
For this application. the temperature stabi l i ty of the TiT,
preparation was important because the gas discharge tubes
had to be baked out at temperatures of several hundred
degrees centigrade. Therefore, investigations were un­
dertaken to see at what temperature tri tium would be re­
l eased from a TiT, preparation with a certain concentration
c of the tri tium.17
III.A. A Remarkable Heating Experiment of a TiT 0.0035
Preparation (Heating Experiment of the First Kind)
The heating experiment presented in Ref. 7 is de­
scribed and evaluated in more detail in th is paper. In a
prel i minary experiment, the evaporation was accom­
plished in a glass bulb with a volume of -500 em' at an
argon pressure of 2 cm of mercury. The evaporator con­
sisted of a tungsten coil on which eight pieces of 7 mg of
titanium. totaling 56 mg, were fixed . This resulted in a
finely d ivided titanium preparation of -48 mg, taking
into account the l oss of titanium caused by al loying with
the tungsten w ire. By adding 100 mei of tri tium. a
TiTo.(Kl3s preparation was obtained. The inaccuracy of the
tri tium concentration, which is estimated at 10%, is of
no importance in the context of this and further heating
experi ments, After pumping out the 'He residue originat­
ing from the beta decay of tri tium, the tube was sealed
off. Then the system was heated in an oven twi ce up to
263
Reifen\chweller DECREASE OF TRITIUM RADIOACTIVITY
-18(FC. and the gas pressure was measured as a function
of temperature hy an ionization gauge. Extensive pump­
ing wa" prevemed hy switching on the ionization gauge
only during the measurements so that its effect could be
neglected. The most important results are illustrated in
Fig. 4. \\'ith the first increase of temperature. the tritium
pressure (graph B) showed no increase at temperatures
below �'" 350°C . and then the pressure increased. With
the second rise of temperature, the tritium pressure
(graph C) increased very much earlier at - 250°e. Ob­
viously, at the first rise of temperature, tritium atoms,
which were released from their bonds to the titanium lat­
tice. could not leave the titanium particles, probably
because of surface contamination (see. e.g., Peisl in
Ref. lit Vol. I, p. 63). This contamination may espe­

cially have been caused during the introduction of the
tritium. and it would have been dissolved in the metal
during the heating up to 480°C at the first temperature
cycle.
In a most important heating experiment, a TiTo.oOJ5
preparatlon was made by the procedure described earlier
in the arrangement shown in Fig. 3 (Fig. I of Ref. 7).
The mean thickness of the titanium layer was calculated
as 0.54 mgkm:. This is nearly the range of IS.6-ke V elec­
trons (the maximum energy of tritium beta particles). 19
Then the system was heated in an oven, and the radio­
acti\'ity was measured via the X radiation by a GM tube.
II was completely impossible to distinguish between
chemisorption at the surface and bulk absorption of the
small titanium particles. as argued in Ref. II, because
�!SO titanium particles were piled up in the layer.2o Be­
cause of the high heat capacity of the system, the rise of

temperature was accomplished slowly and took several
(,� 10) hours. The temperature was measured by three ther­
mocouples at different places of the arrangement, as
shown in Fig. 3. The tritium that was released, if any,
was pumped out continuously. The time constant of the
decrease of tritium pressure was determined for such a
vacuum system to be a few seconds (7 s for a similar
system).
In Fig. 4. graph A gives the count rate as a function
of temperature. It is very strange that the count rate de­
creased sharply between 115 and 160°C by 28% fol­
lowed by a further slower decrease, reaching 60% of the
initial value at 275°C and then rising to 105% of the ini­
tial value at � 360°e.
A constant temperature in this "valley region" cor­
responded to a constant count rate established at 150 and
300°e. With a further increase of the temperature above
360°C, the count rate decreased very fast because of the
decomposition of the preparation.
The sharp decrease of the radioactivity especially be­
tween I 15 and 160°C but also the further slower de­
crease between 160 and 275°C cannot be explained by
decomposition of the TiT 0.0035 preparation. This is clearly
shown by graph B, which represents the increase of the
tritium pressure and hence the release of tritium at a first
rise of temperature: In such a preparation. there is no mea­
surable release of tritium below - 350°e. This statement
is confirmed by many other experiments and also ex­
cludes the possibility of an alternative explanation that
the course of a !(T) in Fig. 4 is simulated by the dif­
fusion of tritium in the preparation from one place to an­
other. But. the strongest argument against decrease of the
radioactivity between 115 and 275°C being caused by a
release of tritium from the TiT 0.0035 preparation is the
fact that the radioactivity increases again between 275
and 360°C to approximately the initial value before de­
composition of the preparation (the 5% higher count rate
above the initial value is due to less absorption of the
X radiation owing to heating of the air between the prep­
aration and the GM tube, as observed in many experi­
ments). This definitely shows that no tritium is lost during
the first decrease of radioactivity.
Supported by the foregoing arguments, we conclude
that something strange occurs in the TiT 0.0035 prepara­
tion during the decrease of the count rate especially be­
tween 115 and 160°C, during the further decrease up to
275°C, and during the renewed increase to approxi­
mately the initial value between 275 and 360°e. We
argued earlier that during the whole temperature trajec­
tory up to 360°C, no loss of tritium occurred. Therefore,
we must conclude that the decrease of count rate was
entirely due to a decrease of tritium radioactivity. Thus,

we arrive at the following preliminary conclusion. In
the temperature region between 115 and 275°C, a new
compound of the tritium is formed in the TiT 0.0035 prep­
aration with a lower radioactive decay constant, and
upon a further increase of temperature and before the
FUSION TECHNOLOGY VOL. 30 NOV. 1996

decomposition of the preparation above 360°C, this lower
emitting compound is destroyed.
A detailed discussion of Fig. 4 is especially interest­
ing. The experiment where a TiT 0.0035 preparation was
heated and the pressure of tritium was measured shows
that at the first rise of temperature, the release of tritium
started seriously at � 3600e (graph B). This is precisely
the temperature where according to graph A. the release
of tritium began, demonstrated by the sharp decrease of
the count rate. However, in a second temperature cycle.
the release of tritium started seriously very much earlier,
in fact, at -275°e (graph e). where according to graph
A, the reincrease of the radioactivity began. In the au­
thor's opinion, the rise of curve e is related to the release
of the tritium atoms from their bonds to the titanium lat­
tice; however. at the first rise of temperature. the liber­
ated tritium could not leave the titanium particles. as
shown by graph B. This release of the tritium atoms from
their bonds to the titanium lattice coincided with the re­
increase of the radioactivity between 275 and 360°C, as
shown by graph A. Obviously. as stated earlier. the tri­
tium atoms, liberated from their bonds to the titanium
lattice, which exhibited normal radioactive decay, could
not leave the small titanium particles at the first rise of
temperature, as shown by graph B. This was probably
caused by surface contamination that was removed dur­
ing the heating to 4800e at the first temperature cycle.
These observations suggest that the re-increase of the ra­
dioactivity between 275 and 3600e and, of course, also
the decrease of the radioactivity between 115 and 275De,
and with it the destruction and formation of the hypo­
thetical lower emitting compound. had something to do
with the bonds of the tritium atoms to the titanium lat­
tice. This remark may be important for a theoretical in­
terpretation of the effect.
III.B. Evaluation of a Further Important Heating
Experiment (Heating Experiment
of the Second Kind)
In my recent letter7 a heating experiment is men­
tioned with a ten times higher concentration of the tri­
tium and a faster increase of temperature, where the
decrease and re-increase of the count rate did not occur.
In the meantime, an interpretation of this experiment has
been found that does show clearly the decrease and re­
increase of radioactivity for this TiT 0.035 preparation dur­
ing heating.
Figure 5 shows schematically the experimental ar­
rangement. Two tubes with low heat capacity. according
to Fig. 2. were used. In both tubes. a preparation of
48 mg of finely divided titanium was made by evapora­
tion of the metal in argon of 2 cm of mercury. In tube S.
I ei of tritium was absorbed in the titanium. After re­
moving the 'He. which was left from the beta decay of
the tritium. valve 2 was closed. and valves I and 3 were

opened. Then tube S was placed in an oven (see also
Fig. 3) and was heated slowly but about five times faster
than in the preceding experiment. The tritium. which was
released from the preparation of tube S. was absorbed by
the titanium preparation of tube G, which was left at room
temperature. The radioactivity in both tubes was deter­
mined relatively via the X radiation by two GM tubes.
Graph S on Fig. 6a gives the count rate of tube S
(solid), and graph g gives the count rate of tube G (gas).
The count rate 5 is constant up to -·21 ODe and then de­
creases steeply. At the same temperature. the increase of
the count rate g begins. This may lead to a preliminary

conclusion that the tritium is desorbed from preparation
S and that this tritium is absorbed by preparation G.
To proceed to a more complete evaluation of this ex­
periment, we normalize the count rate of tube G to the
same sensitivity as count rate S. Figure 6b gives the nor­
malized count rate G together with the count rate S. The
count rate G thus gives the radioactivity of the tritium
gas released from tube S. and 5 + G is a measure of the
total radioactivity. This count rate 5 + G is plotted in
Fig. 6b. As one can see. a similar decrease and re-increase
of the count rate takes place as in Fig. 4. The decrease
starts at a higher temperature than in the experiment de­
scribed in Sec. lILA, at � 2\ O°e, right at the beginning
of the pure alpha phase.:!1 If we attribute the decrease of
the radioactivity to only the solid preparation in tube S.
we obtain graph S'.
Most interesting is the evaluation of the decrease of
radioactivity 5 above 2\ O°e, At 230°e, 5 has decreased
by 10.6'* ([LlCRsb30 c): the increase of G. the tritium­
gas released from S. is only 0.859;' ([ .lCRu b30 c). thus.

and (LlCRJLlCRd2-12'c 10.5. Thus. the strong de-

by the release of tritium from the preparation. This is a
further strong argument for the decrease of tritium radio­
activity due to heating of our preparation above 21OcC.
Also very important is the fact that the re-increase of the
total radioactivity S + G begins at the same temperature
as in the experiment of Fig. 4 and ends also at -360°C.
It is particularly interesting that this experiment was
carried out under conditions quite different from those in
the experiment of Fig. 4, with a 10 times higher and vari­
able (decreasing) concentration. At a minimum radio­
activity of 275°C (graph S') the concentration c is -8.5
times higher than in the experiment of Fig. 4, and it de­
creases strongly during the re-increase of the radioactivity.
A possible error in the foregoing interpretation could
be that the tritium released from preparation S is too
266
slowly absorbed by preparation G, so that a certain amount
of tritium remains in the tubes as a gas. However, this is
contradicted by the statement that the finely divided ti­
tanium preparation that is deposited in tube G absorbs
the tritium fast at room temperature (Sec. II). Further­
more, a very strong contradiction to this objection is the
measurement at 313°C where the temperature of tube S
is kept constant during 15 min. If a measurable amount
of tritium were left as a gas, this would show up as a
measurable increase in the count rate G during the stay
at 313°C. Such behavior was not observed. To be abso­
lutely sure that no tritium is left as a gas in the tube. one
should place a pressure gauge in the connecting tube be­
tween the two preparations.
IItC. Oxidized Preparations
Two other heating experiments using the experimen­
tal setup of Fig. 3 were carried out. After preparation of
the titanium-tritium compounds. they were exposed to
ambient air, a TiT OJ)()J5 preparation for 2 h, and a TiT 0.065
preparation for 3 days, both before heating. For both prep­
arations, the count rate determined by a GM tube was
decreased by this procedure by - 10%. This decrease of
count rate must be due to a change in the efficiency of
the external bremsstrahlung due to absorption of this gas.
This result is important for estimating the influence of
oxygen on the efficiency of external bremsstrahlung gen­
eration: The large changes in count rate given in graph A
of Fig. 4 and in graph S of Fig. 6 can never be caused by
the small oxygen contamination of the preparations. Fur­
thermore, the observations have a bearing on the inter­
pretation of the experiment described in Sec. IV, where
the addition of tritium caused a decrease of the total beta
emission of the preparation. With both (partially) oxi­
dized preparations, a distinct decrease and re-increase of
the ClJunt rate during heating was observed. as shown in
Fig. 7. However, the decrease and re-increase of the ra­
dioactivity was not so clear, and the diminution was not
so strong as with the preparations of Figs. 4 and 6b. Fur­
thermore, it seems that for these oxidized preparations,
the re-increase of the radioactivity began at a somewhat
lower temperature than for the "pure" preparations. It is
most interesting that with the TiT 0.0650Z preparation
where the tritium concentration was nearly two times
higher than with the preparation of Fig. 6, no desorption
of tritium occurred before the original radioactivity was
recovered, obviously because of the strong oxide layer
on the surface of the titanium particles. But, it seems from
these experiments that oxidation of the preparation does
not stimulate the decrease of radioactivity.

111.0. Conclusions from the Heating Experiments
and Recommendations
With a more complete evaluation of our heating ex­
periments than in Ref. 7, I have obtained a high degree

of evidence for the effect of the decrease of the radio­
activity of tritium during heating of our TiTc prepara­
tions. Two experiments carried out under quite different
conditions showed that the maximum decrease of A oc­
curred at the same temperature, at 275°C, and with fur­
ther increasing temperature, the lower emitting compound
of tritium was destroyed (Figs. 4 and 6b). It appears that
two processes are in competition as a function of increas­
ing temperature: the formation of the lower emitting com­
pound (Fig. 4, graph A, 115°C < T < 275°C) and the
destruction of this compound by liberation of the tritium
atoms (nuclei) from their bonds to the titanium lattice
(Fig. 4, graphs C and A for T> 160°C). Evidently, at
275°C, equilibrium of these two processes was attained,
and with further increasing temperature, the second pro­
cess predominated. It is particularly interesting that the
relative contribution of these two processes appears to
be independent of the concentration.
Two other experiments, where the TiT, preparations
(c 0.0035 and c = 0.065) were strongly oxidized, also
distinctly showed the decrease and re-increase of the ra­
dioactivity during heating (Fig. 7).
A most straightforward interpretation of our heating
experiments was possible applying a preparation where
the tritium was not released up to the temperature where
the initial radioactivity was restored, indicated as a heat­
ing experiment of the first kind (Sec. lILA, Fig. 4: low
concentration, barrier at the surface of the titanium par­
ticles that prevents desorption of the tritium). It may be a
fortuitous and fortunate circumstance that at the time of
the heating experiments, the ultrahigh vacuum (UHV 1
technique was not available. Without the surface layer
preventing the release of tritium with the experiment of

re-increase would have been observed. In this case, the

conclusion would have been that the tritium is desorbed
when the temperature is increased above 115°C The

change in radioactivity during heating would not have
been noticed. Therefore, with experiments of this kind, it
is most important to apply a surface barrier, e.g" an ox­
ide layer, to prevent early desorption of tritium when
working with the UHV technique. The thickness of such
a layer can be precisely determined by the amount of
added oxygen. Another means to prevent early desorp­
tion of the hydrogen isotope from the titanium would be
embedding the TiT, preparation in a nonoccluder with a
low diffusion coefficient for hydrogen. e.g., gold. But, in
any case, it is recommended that one apply a second tube
G ( Fig. 5) to determine a possible release of tritium from
preparation S.
It is particularly interesting to compare the experi­
ment of Fig. 4 with that of Fig. 6b. where tritium was
released from the preparation during heating, indicated
as a heating experiment of the second kind. According to
our preliminary interpretation. graph C in Fig. 4 shows
the release of the tritium atoms (nuclei) from their bonds
to the titanium lattice, but the liberated tritium atoms could
not leave the small titanium particles below -360°C
(graph B). They had normal A. and the re-increase of the
radioactivity above 275°C \vas due to these liberated tri­
tium atoms remaining in the preparation. In Fig. 6b. graph
G shows again the release of the tritium atoms from their
bonds to the titanium lattice. but in this experiment. the
tritium left the small titanium particles as a gas because
of the ten times higher concentration. This gaseous tri­
tium, too, has normal A. If we add in Fig. 6b both radio­
activities. the decreased radioactivity in the solid and the
normal radioactivity in the gas. we get graphs S + G
or S', respectively. In the experiment of Fig. 4. the addi­
tion of these two radioacti\'ities is accomplished auto­
matically in graph A because the liberated tritium atoms
with normal radioactivity remained in the titanium par­
ticles. From this evaluation. we understand the analogous
course of the radioactivities as a function of temperature
in both experiments: first. a decrease of the radioactivities
at a certain temperature. and then above :n5°C. a re­
increase to the normal radioactivity. In the experiment of
Fig. 4, we again have in the temperature region above
360°C, a return to the normal radioactivity as in Fig. 6b
because the gas released from the preparation had nor­
mal radioactivity (we could have measured it with a sec­
ond tube Gl.
It is virtually impossible that the course of a l(n
is determined by a measurement artifact in the counting
arrangements in the experiments of Figs. 3 and 4 and
Figs. 5 and 6. If this were actually to be the case. then
one would have to assume that the efficiency of the count­
ing arrangement changes in such a way that the course
of a f<n results as obsened in Fig. 4. In the experi­
ment of Figs. 5 and 6. the efficiency of each of the two
counting arrangements would then have to change in such
a way that the observed course of S + G. which is equiv­
alent to the course of (/ .n n in Fig. 4. would be
produced.
267
Reifen�chwei ler DECREASE OF TRITIUM RADIOACTIVITY
The decrease of the radioactivity begins in the ex­
periment of Fig. 6 at a higher temperature ( - 210°C) than
in the experiment of Fig. 4 (115°C). In Fig. 6, this indi­
cates the beginning of the pure alpha phase.11 This obser­
vation suggests that monocrystallinity may be a necessary
condition for the decrease of the radioactivity because
monocrystallinity is destroyed when tritium is added at
room temperature (by extremely small hydride particles)
and is regained when the preparation enters the pure al­
pha phase. In the experiment of Fig. 4, the decrease of
the radioactivity also occurred in the pure alpha phase.
Of particular interest will be experiments in which
the temperature is decreased starting from the value where
the radioactivity is recovered after the decrease as in
Fig. 4 from 360°C. In our experiments, this was not done
because the only question was the temperature stability
of the preparations.
The release of tritium atoms (nuclei) from their bonds
to the titanium lattice can be prevented by maintaining
an equilibrium pressure of tritium above the preparation
(Ref. 22. pp. 336-345). indicated as a heating experi­
ment of the third kind. With this mode of operation, we
may expect a further decrease of the radioactivity than
was obtained in the experiments of Figs. 4 and 6. It may
be somewhat difficult to measure directly the a = J(Tt
graphs because one has to adjust continuously the equi­
librium pressure during heating to maintain a constant
concentration c. With a straightforward mode of opera­
tion, the tritium concentration has to be slowly increased
at fixed temperatures T, and from the a = J( C)T graphs.
the most interesting a = J(T)c graphs can be determined.
In the proposed isothermal experiments maintaining
an equilibrium pressure. the radioactivity is advanta­
geously determined by measuring the X-ray spectrum with
modern detectors. The tritium pressure above the TiT,.
preparation and the contribution of this tritium to the
X-ray intensity has to be carefully measured.
Until now, in all heating experiments, the formation
of the lower emitting compound occurred in the alpha
phase of TiT,. (Ref. 21 ). It is extremely interesting to per­
form heating experiments also with a high tritium con­
centration. with hydride-phase TiTc. Such experiments
are advantageously accomplished applying an equilib­
rium pressure as described earlier.
For a theoretical interpretation of the effect, it may
be important that the tritium atoms (nuclei) be bound as
harmonic oscillators in the titanium lattice.23.24
From the course of a = J(T) (Fig. 4), we can deter­
mine the concentration of tritium with normal A and that
of the "compound" with decreased A. These concentra­
tions as a function of temperature follow the well-known
laws of chemical equilibrium. A detailed discussion of
the related thermodynamical functions that also presup­
poses careful determination of disturbing effects [e.g., re­
lease of the tritium atoms (nuclei) from their bonds to
the titanium lattice] may lead to a deeper understanding
of the decrease of tritium radioactivity.
268
IV. TiT" EXPERIMENTS
Through our heating experiments, we arrived at the

preliminary conclusion that under certain conditions-in
our case. by heating TiT,. preparations (with c = 0.0035.
0.035. and 0.065 i-a new compound of the tritium in
the small titanium particles with lower A is formed. How­
ever, there is no physical effect known that accomplishes
the observed decrease of radioactivity. Therefore, fur­
ther experiments must be performed to search for an ex­
planation of the observed effect.
It was speculated that the decrease of the tritium ra­
dioactivity in the small titanium particles may have some­
thing to do with the different phases of the TiTc system,
a suspicion that so far has not been confirmed. There­
fore, experiments were undertaken to measure the radio­
activity a as a function of the concentration c in such
systems. The concentration c was taken as independent
variable x, and the related experiments are therefore in­
dicated as TiT, experiments. It would be very interesting
to do such experiments at different temperatures (see Sec.
III.D), but until now, only TiT x experiments at room tem­
perature have been done. All TiT x experiments are per­
formed using the tube shown in Fig. I.
In all TiT, experiments, a substantial deviation from
the expected proportionality between radioactivity and
concentration x was observed. The lJ.a1tu is not constant
with increasing concentration x but shows characteristic
variations.
In the most important TiT, experiment,7 4.92 mg of
titanium was evaporated in argon at a pressure of I cm
mercury. After removal of the evaporator, the titanium
left on it was determined quantitatively as 1.33 mg. Thus,
the titanium soot layer contained 3.6 mg of titanium. The
mean thickness of the titanium layer was calculated as
l.l5 X 10-2 mglcm2 (25 nm). According to the energy­
range relation of electrons, 19 there could be no essential
absorption effect of the beta electrons of tritium. The par­
ticle size was � 16 nm. After preparation of the titanium
soot layer, the system was sealed off.
Small glass bottles with volumes of 2 and 4 cm3 were
filled with tritium at a gas pressure of 7.5 X 10 - 3 mm
mercury via a hydrogen pressure regulator:' These little
bottles were sealed to the vacuum system, and the tntium
was introduced by opening a breaking seal. By addition
of one bottle of 2 cm3, the increase of the concentration
was tu = 2.2 X 10-5. To exclude a possible influence of
the sequence of the preparation of the bottles, we applied
the bottles at random. The beta electrons emitted from
the TiT, layer were measured via a cylindrical electrode
inside the vessel by a vibrating reed electrometer. This
electrometer allowed the total current to be electroni­
cally compensated after each measurement to zero, so
that the following lJ.i 'X lJ.a could be determined accu­
rately. By recording the tritium pressure using a special
tube that measures the beta emission of the gaseous tri­
tium, we ascertained that the tritium had been absorbed

for the uptake of tritium ensured that the loading oc­
curred uniformly.
Figure 8 gives the results of the experiment. The first
value of t:.altu was taken as 100%. The experiment took
several weeks.  The t:.al tu decreased first, reaching a
min imum of �55% of the in itial value at x"'" 3 X 10-4•
After reaching the min imum, t:.altu i ncreased again and
reached the initi al value at x = 4.5 x 10-4• Then t:.altu
decreases again and reached -85% of the initial value at
x = 1.3 X 10-3• This i s  the same value as was obtained
in two other i ndependent experiments.
From the course of t:.alt:.x = f(x) reaching a mini­
mum and i ncreasing again to the initial value, a nuclear
pair hypothesis was derived as fol lows. Two tritium nu­
clei (identical nuclei with half integer spin) under cer­
tain condi tions (in our case, by embedding i n  small
monocrystalIine particles of titan i u m) arrange them­
selves in a pair with nuclear spin zero. Such a nuclear
pair acts for the decay to a certain extent as the parent
nucleus, so that the radioactive decay changes to a cer­
tain extent i nto a higher forbidden one.
The author would l ike to emphasize that the nuclear
pair hypothesis i s  a hypothesis. Thi s  i mplies that i t  i s  a
first attempt to explain the strange effect of the decrease
of tritium radioactivity. It is to be proved or d isproved by
further experiments, and if this hypothesis cannot be con­
firmed, we must search for another explanation of the
effect. Furthermore, nothing has yet been said about the
nature of the hypothetical nuclear pairs. a
Pairing of atomic nuclei could be demonstrated by
nuclear spin resonance. Also, scattering experiments with
polarized neutrons might be i nteresting.
"There is a well-known example for pair formation of elemen­
tary particles at a long distance: the Cooper pairs in supercon­
ductivity. A new entity is formed: The mass is experimentally
determined as 2me- the electrical charge as 2e. and the spin as
zero.
FUSION TECHNOLOGY VOL. 30 NOV. 1996
According to the theory of beta decay. the transfor­
mation of the decay to a higher forbidden one has re­
markable consequences: The maxi mum of the energy
spectrum and the mean energy must be shifted to h igher
energies. To be sure about this i nteresting fundamental
effect, one must perform an ionization chamber, or het­
ter sti l l ,  a proportional counter-type experiment.
The foregoing derivation of the nuclear pair hypoth­
esis presupposed that the tritium nuclei are uniformly in­
corporated into the domains where pair formation takes
place. If we assume random incorporation and that the
nuclear pair hypothesis is true, we reach by elementary
mathematics the following expression:
�: x�: A2 + (AI - A2)exp( -2�) .
where
a = radioactiv ity
A) = decay constant of unpaired nuclei
A2 =:: decay constant of paired nuclei
n = number of radioactive nuclei in the prepara­
tion
N = number of domains in the preparation where pair
formation takes place.
With random i ncorporation, t:.a/� decreases expo­
nentially with increasing concentration x to the lower
value of the decay constant. This was i ndicated in our
experiment where �al tu was decreased at x = 13 X ) 0 -.!
to �85% of the in itial value ( not shown in Fig. 3 of
Ref. 7). Random incorporation i nstead of uniform incor­
poration was probably caused by increasing  impurities
at the surface of the titanium particles duri ng the course
of the experiment so that thermodynamical equil ihrium
with an equal concentration of tritium in the ti tanium par­
ticles could not be attained.
There have been several other TiT, experiments with
interesting results. However, i n  these experiments. which
269
Reifen�chweiler DECREASE OF TRITIUM RADIOACTIVITY
were carried out before the experiment just described. I
the evaporator was not removed and could have ab-
sorbed some tritium.
In two independent TiT, experiments. small addi­
tions of tritium of approximately the same amount as in
the preceding experiment were added from a calibrated
volume to preparations of 3.6 mg of titanium. The min­
imum of ..lal.lx shown in Fig. 8 was not observed. The
.lal..lx decreased (ex ponentially) in both experiments and
reached -80ge of the initial value at x = 2.3 x I O-�.
Obviously. we had the condition for random incorpora­
tion of the tritium atoms into the titanium particles as
argued earlier. At x = 1.3 x IO-�. we had the same value
of ..lal.l.t as found in the preceding experiment. With fur­
ther additions of tritium . ..lal.l.t decreased very sharply
to - I  £,t of the initial value at x = 2.3 X 10-3• This sug­
gests that the decrease of the radioactivity was very sharp

in the hydrid phase. But. this conclusion should be taken
provisionally with extreme caution because the evapora­
tor might have absorbed some tritium. It would be very
interesting to repeat these experiments removing the evap­
orator and applying UHV conditions until the prepara­
tion is completely saturated.
During the two experiments just described, several
very strange events were observed. The addition of tri­
tium caused a decrease of the total beta emission of the
preparation (..lal..lx < 0). This always occurred after an
increase of the electron emission of the preparation dur­
ing a longer period (one or several days) whereby the
preparation was left on the vacuum installation or after
addition of a small amount of oxygen. Figure 9 presents
the results of such an experiment. The tritium concen-
tration was x 3.7 X 10-3, and the tritium addition
was dx = 6 x 10-5; PT gives the tritium pressure as a
function of time. measured with a special tube. The slow
absorption of the tritium was caused by surface contam­
ination of the preparation. After 30 min. practically all
the tritium was absorbed by the preparation; < I % was
left. The dUE is the signal of the TiT< tube (Fig. I) cor­
rected for the beta emission of the gaseous tritium and
for the ionization of the neutral gas during the period
where the valve to the vacuum pump was closed. The
dUE is proportional to da, dx is obtained from PT and
da begins to decrease immediately from zero after the
addition of tritium. It is striking that da and da/dx de­
creased further with time when all the tritium was ab­
sorbed. The total decrease of the emission was -20% of
the normal increase, which had to be observed with the
addition of tritium. Also, the next addition of tritium re­
sulted in a decrease of the total emission (da/dx < 0),
but the decrease was smaller, only one-fourth of that of
the preceding addition.
By careful evaluation of the experiments with da/
dx < 0 applying the formalism of random incorpora­

tion, we arrive at the conclusion that the decrease of the
total electron emission can be explained by the nuclear
pair hypothesis. To get a decrease of the total emission,
A2 must be in any case «0.5 X A I' This stresses the con­
clusion that in the two experiments described earlier, AT
was decreased very sharply in the hydrid phase.
In his opposing note, Wicke I

argued that the course
of daldx f(x) shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. 7 was caused by
oxidation of the titanium surface followed by reduction
by the added tritium. The formed T 20 would then desorb

and thus be lost for current determi nation by the elec­
trometer device. This argument can of course also be ap­
plied to the experiments with il.alil.x < O. However, one
must realize that the enthalpy of formation of I mol of
titanium oxide is nearly two times that of 2 mol of water.
But, i n  any case, if the most i nteresting TiT. experiment
with il.alil.x < 0 were to be repeated, additional means
would have to be applied to determine any T 20 possibly
desorbed from the preparation.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
As mentioned in Ref. 7. the decrease of tritium ra­
dioactivity may have a bearing on the cold deuterium­
deuterium ( D-D) fusion effect. 2 5  For the present, we have
two different effects: cold D-D fusion and a decrease of
tritium radioactivity. However. there is  a strong suspi­
cion that the same or a related fundamental principle un­
derlies both effects: Atoms (nuclei) of hydrogen i sotopes
are bound in suitable metals. and nuclear properties are
changed in a manner not understandable. Cold D-D fu­
sion experiments w ith deuterium absorbed in finely d i ­
v ided preparations of hydrogen absorbers (t itan i um ,
palladium. o r  others) a s  used i n  our tri ti um experiments
are proposed. The determination of the intensity of cold
D-D fusion as a function of temperature may enable a
thermodynamical treatment (see Sec. III .D).  This may be
a way to arrive at a deeper understanding of the phenom­
enon.
The fact that sometimes cold D-D fusion experi­
ments with a positive result are not reproducible points
to the existence of an underlying hidden necessary con­
dition. For the decrease of tritium radioactivity, such a
necessary condition may be monocrystal l inity of the small
titanium particles. Monocrystallinity is a most strik ing
property of our preparations. This may be important for
the theory of the effect because such a monocrystalline
particle i s  one quantum mechanical system.  Whether a
decrease of tri ti um radioactivity also occurs with non­
monocrystalline particle should be investigated. In experi­
ments with copper done for nuclear magnetic resonance
i nvestigations, such nonmonocrystalline particles were
prepared by evaporation of the metal at a higher argon
pressure.
In this connection, it may be i nteresting that in the
cold fusion experiment done by Fleischmann and Pons.26
where excess enthalpy was clearly observed, analogous
conditions for the formation of small pallad ium-hydride
particles existed. as was the case for the formation of
our small titanium particles prepared by gas evapora­
tion. I ncreasing the concentration of deuterium above the
end of the alpha phase ( PdD � O Ol )' obtains supersatura­
tion of the alpha phase, which results i n  homogeneous
nucleation. �7 This brings about small monocrystall ine par­
ticles of pal ladium deuteride ( PdD , o o) '  Obtain ing ho-

mogeneous nucleation requires very pure palladium metal,
which is a condition that is also necessary for the pro­
duction of excess enthalpy as reported by Fleischmann
and Pons.26 Otherwise, one obtains i nhomogeneous nu­
cleation with the formation of bigger and non mono­
crystalline deuteride particles. I t  i s  suggested t hat the
microstructure and possible monocrystal l inity of the pal­
l ad i um deuteride suspended i n  the pal ladium matrix
should be i nvestigated by metal lographic tech n iques
( Ref. 22, p. 353) at different states of saturation.
With both effects. cold D-D fusion and a decrease of
tritium radioactivity, identical particles i nteract. Cold D-D
fusion gives the possibility of checking if such inter­
actions are possible only between identical particles ( in­
dicated as  homointeractions) or also between nonidentical
particles (indicated as heterointeractions ) .  If  one gets neu­
tron production in a cold fusion experiment by the D-D
reaction, one must repeat the experiment with a mixture
of 50% deuterium and 50% tritium. If we have hetero­
interaction, one must then observe a h igh i ntensity of
1 4-MeV neutrons from the deuterium-tritium ( D-T ) re­
action. The result of such an experiment i s  very i mpor­
tant for the theoretical i nterpretation of the cold fusion
effect. If the reaction occurs only between identical par­
ticles, many theories are ruled out.
Also, the effect of decrease of trit ium radioactiv ity
may offer a means to dist inguish between homo- and het­
erointeractions. If a heating experiment is performed with
a distinct result, one must repeat the experiment with the
addition of an amount of hydrogen and at another time
with an amount of deuterium both equal to the amount of
the added tri tium. If a heterointeraction takes place, the
course of a = f(T) would be entirely different from that
observed with pure tri tium.
