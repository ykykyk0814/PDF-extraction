A sensitive open-type calorimeter was used to measure excess heat production during electrolysis
in Li2SO4/H2O solution with Pt-anode and Pd-Ni thin film cathodes 9000 Å thick, sputtered on Al2O3
substrate. In order to estimate the actual performance and possible measurement errors during electrolysis
in the calorimeter used, including heat convection, bubbling and possible H2+O2 recombination, smooth Pt
sheets were used as cathodes in special reference runs. It is shown that the Alumina/ Pd-Ni sample that
survived during electrolysis achieved excess heat production of 20-25 % of the input power
(equivalent to 300 ± 30 mW).


1. INTRODUCTION

For the last decade there were numerous reports concerning heat generation in the electrochemical
cells with Pd or Ni cathodes. It was claimed that the bulk Pd cathodes may generate some excess heat in
heavy water based alkaline electrolyte [1,2], both in open cell and in closed- type cells with a recombiner.
In order to generate excess heat with a Pd cathode a certain parameter regime is required, including a very
high current densities and over-potentials, high loading ratio (x=D/Pd) and high deuterium diffusivity, as
well as especial treatment of the cathode-samples (annealing, etching, etc.) [3]. The same irreproducibility
of heat generation was found for electrolysis of massive Ni-cathodes in the H2O based electrolytes [4,5].
Heat production in the Ni-H system has been studied much less than in Pd-D. In that case possible heat
generation has been attributed to formation of Ni-hydride β-phase under special loading conditions. At the
same time it is well known that high loading for Ni samples is more difficult to obtain than that for Pd [6].
Thus, the irreproducibility of heat production in the Ni-H system with massive cathodes is generally
regarded to be as poor as that of the Pd-D system. It should be noted that irreproducibility and the relatively
low level of heat production in Pd or Ni-cathodes during electrochemical loading has prompted alternative
trivial explanations of the observed thermal effects, e.g. gas H2+O2 recombination and/or changes in the
faradic efficiency of open-cell electrolysis upon the cathodic polarization of Pd [7].

In this connection, the more perspective way to obtain reproducible heat generation in the metal-
hydrogen electrochemical systems is, in our opinion, utilization of thin-metal film cathodes on dielectric
substrates [8]. The advantages of the thin-film cathodes include: (i) a very short time is required to achieve
as high hydrogen loading due to small metal thickness; (ii) an effective hydrogen reflection at the Pd-
dielectric interface from the dielectric side, increasing the effective concentration of hydrogen in metal; (iii)
relatively low current density can be used to provide the necessary condition for heat generation [3]; (iiii) a
large input power density Win is applied to the metal –hydrogen system (at film thickness of 2000 A,
typically Win ~ 103-104 W/cm3, while for 1 mm thick Pd wire at least 3 orders of magnitude less even at
much higher current density), which allow increase in the H-diffusion amplitude in Pd lattice.

In the present paper, a sensitive open-type calorimeter is used to demonstrate that Pd-Ni thin film
cathodes sputtered on a Alumina dielectric substrate during electrolysis in 1M Li2SO4/H2O with a Pt-wire
anode reproducibly generates heat at the level of 20-25 % of the input power during long time runs. We
show that the generated heat cannot be explained by conventional chemical mechanisms, including H2+O2
recombination.

2. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE

In order to detect possible heat evolution during electrolysis runs in the present work, a high
sensitivity open-type calorimeter has been employed. This calorimeter consists of a large constant
temperature water bath (30 l of water) in which four double-wall glass cells are immersed. During the
experiments the bath temperature was strictly stabilized with Circulating Bath device and precisely fixed at
the point of 28.0 ± 0.05 °C. Each cell was covered by a rubber cap and provided with two thermistors,
magnetic stirrer (to exclude thermal gradients which can essentially distort the actual temperature in the cell
due to convection) and plastic cathode-holder, to maintain the cathode inside the electrolyte (Fig.1). All
thermistors were calibrated with a sensitive mercury thermometer. The error of this calibration was 0.1 °C.
The temperature difference ∆T=Tx-T0 between the thermistors inside the cells (Tx) and the bath temperature
(T0) was monitored evry five minutes.

Calibration of cells in the range of 0.05 – 5.0 W input power was carried out using a standard
R=70 ohm resistor. The calorimeter’s time constant (time for stabilization of the temperature after a change
in input power) is ~ 4 hrs. The average resistor-calibration error < 25 mW. Measurements show a high
sensitivity of  200 ± 25 mW/°C or 5.0 °C per 1 W of input electric energy .
To account the actual ohmic heating of the electrolyte due to electrolysis (potential drop due to
electrical resistance of electrolyte, cathode, anode and electric circuit) the water dissociation potential
(WDP) is subtracted from the electrolysis voltage. The minimal WDP value for oxygen acid salts
electrolyte [9] can be estimated as:
U0 = Uth + η0.                                                   (1),
Here Uth = 1.48 V is the thermal neutral dissociation potential and η0-is the sum of cathode and anode over-
potentials (for a Ni(cathode)-Pt(anode) pair: η0 = 0.58 V; for a Pt-Pt pair: η0 = 0.53 V and so on). Direct
experimental measurements of WDP (using volt-ampere characteristics in the cell measured between
cathode and anode) performed for these electrode pairs in our electrochemical cells show a good agreement
(within the 5 % of theoretical value) of U0 values from formula (1).
In the present work, a double-layer Pd/Ni thin film sputtered on ceramic Al2O3 substrate was used
as a cathode [10]. The flat substrate samples with area S=12.5 cm2 were cut from ceramic plate of 1 mm
thick and roughness of 8-10 kÅ. After chemical and ultrasonic cleaning of substrate plates, magnetron
sputtering of 8000 Å Pd was carried out (sputtering rate ~ 0.41 Å/s). On the top of the Pd film the 1000 Å
thick Ni film was sputtered with the same rate. The samples were then annealed in high-vacuum (p=10-7
tor) at t = 800 °C for 4 min using low heating and cooling rates

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

3.1 OPTIMIZATION OF EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT

To check actual performance during Foreground electrolysis runs (with Alumina/Pd-Ni samples),
including heat convection, bubbling, electrode’s geometry, and positioning, as well as H2+O2
recombination. Smooth Pt sheets were used as cathodes in Reference runs, since Pt does not produce excess
heat in the light water electrolysis [3]. To closely replicate the runs the cathode Pt sheets were attached to
the surface of a standard Alumina substrate. The reference experiments used three different Pt-wire anode
types fixed at different distances from cathode Pt-sheets: (I) long-straight wire parallel in front of the center
of the cathode surface (cathode-anode distance 10 mm); (II) loop-like wire coil parallel in front of the
cathode surface and separated by 25 mm distance from the cathode; (III) hook-like coil 25mm above the
cathode surface.  Reference runs   were performed in 3 cells containing the same cathodes and anodes (I-
III) with the input power ranging from 0.1- 3.0 W. The performance of this runs at various current (50 –
600 mA) is defined by the calorimeter “heat recovery” value R as follows:
R =  Pth/I(U-U0)                                                             (2),
where, Pth  is the thermal power measured in calorimeter by thermistors; I and U are the electrolysis current
and voltage, respectively; U0 = 2.01 V is an effective water dissociation potential for Pt/Pt pair defined in
Eq. (1). If the cell with Pt electrodes is calibrated correctly and it does not produce any excess heat, so R ≈
100 %. That is, the thermal power generated is solely due to ohmic/Joule heating of the electrolyte by

3
applied current and voltage.  If R > 100% for Pt/Pt electrodes indicates that there is H2+O2 recombination.
If R<100 %, an incorrect calibration or increase of WDP (U0) due to an anomalous increase in the cell inner
resistance is suggested.

The results of experiments in cells I-III with the same Pt-cathodes and different Pt-anode
configurations, described above are presented in Table 1 (averaged by 50-600 mA current heat recovery
values R). As seen, the R value closest to 100 % was in Cell II with a loop-like anode. Heat recovery R in
cells I and III are larger than 100 %, suggesting that H2+O2 recombination is not negligible. For anode (I) in
cell 1 the recombination contribution would be about 16 %, while for anode (III) in cell 3 it is about 10 %.
In contrast to these “bad anode geometries” (cells I and III), cell II shows that recombination contribution is
≤ 3.0 %. Increasing the cathode-anode distance by 25 mm in cell I, leads to a decrease in R from 116 to 108
%. Thus, it is shown that the best arrangement of anode is consistent with (II).

In the other reference experiments with Pt-Pt electrodes possible changes in electrolyte
concentration were estimated. Electrolysis runs carried out in electrolytes with different molarities show a
quite constant R at Li2SO4/H2O concentrations within 0.8-1.2 M (Table 1). Such large changes could only
associated with evaporation of 20 % volume of the cell. Therefore, changes in the electrolyte concentration
during the cell operation do not significantly affect the heat recovery R.

Note that substitution of thermal-neutral dissociation potential U=1.48 V (without accounting of
electrodes over-voltages) in formula (2) for cell I-III leads to a drastic decrease R below 80 %. This fact
indicates the non-negligibility of the electrodes over-potentials, at least, on calorimetry measurements at
current densities j ≥ 10 mA/cm2.

3.2 ALUMINA/PD-NI CATHODE RESULTS

Experiments on detection of heat generation for Alumina/Pd-Ni cathodes (Foreground runs) were
carried out at constant electrolysis current ranging from I =100-600 mA (j = 8.5 - 50.0 mA/cm2)
corresponding to a cell voltage U 3.5-5.5 V. To calculate Joule heating of the electrolyte P* the effective
WDP value U0 = 2.06 V is used in formula (2). This U0 corresponds to a Ni(cathode)/Pt(anode) electrode
pair WDP (1000 Å Ni film used on the top of the Pd layer).
Typical kinetics of the heat measurement (Pth vs. elapsed time t) are presented in Fig.2 As seen
after t > 2 hrs, the thermal yield Pth exceeds Joule heating P*. The maximal heat recovery R of 135 %
occurs at electrolysis current I=100 mA (j = 8.0 mA/cm2), while the corresponding absolute value of excess
heat production is Wex = 60 ± 28 mW. Increasing the current density to 48 mA/cm2 leads to decrease in heat
recovery R from 135 to 115 %. In typical cases the excesses heat evolution from the cathode at I = 200 mA
continues for ~ 15 days. The decrease in R during a long Foreground run is accompanied by an increase in
cell voltage. The last process indicates an increase in the cell inner resistance due to defects and micro-
cracks generation in Pd/Ni cathode. The cathode samples survive, i.e. they do not detach the Alumina
substrate during these long runs. Thermistor calibration runs repeated immediately after this Foreground
run show that calorimeter parameters, (including ∆T vs. Win) did not change during the time of operation
with Alumina/Pd-Ni sample (15 days). This gives a proof of stability of the calorimetry system and
indicates that our measurements of excess heat production were actually correct.

3.3 ERROR ANALYSIS IN THE HEAT MEASUREMENTS

The main errors of open-type calorimetry are associated with calorimeter accuracy as well as with
gas recombination. As discussed in sec. 3.1 the recombination limit for the cell II-type configuration could
not exceed 3.0 % of the input power. Other possible sources of errors would be referenced to uncertainty of
calorimeter, such as thermistors accuracy, oscillation of bath and ambient temperatures, appearance of
thermal gradients and the change in the electrolyte volume due to evaporation. Results for the calorimetric
accuracy with respect to the precision of excess heat measurement are summarized in Table 2.  The total
average error of heat measurement, in accordance with error propagation, does not exceed <σt> = ± 30
mW. In an actual experimental performance at low input power (Win < 1.0 W) this error is <σl> = ± 20
mW, while at high input power range (Win > 1.0 W) it is twice larger: <σh> = ± 40 mW.

Comparison of the calorimetry errors with excess power gains obtained in Foreground runs with
Aumina/Pd-Ni cathode shows that observed amounts of excess heat generated during electrolysis are well
above the error limit determined by both the calorimetry accuracy and possible recombination.


4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Measurements of excess heat production were carried out during electrolysis in 1M Li2SO4/H2O
solution with Pt-anode and Pd-Ni thin film cathodes (9000 Å thick) sputtered on the dielectric substrate
(Alumina). In order to estimate the actual performance during electrolytic runs in the open-type calorimeter
used, including heat convection, bubbling and possible H2+O2 recombination, smooth Pt sheets were used
as cathodes. It was found that in the “good geometry” (with a loop-shape wire Pt-anode separated by 25
mm distance from cathode) a maximal contribution of H2+O2 recombination in the heat production does not
exceed 3.0 %

No excess heat was measured if the metallic coating of cathode-sample was fractured and/or
detached from the substrate, adding confidence in the calorimetric calibration. The best adhesion of Pd/Ni
coating having a good film quality was achieved with Alumina (with maximal roughness of about 10 kÅ)
as a substrate. This required a special procedure of high-vacuum annealing at t = 800 ºC. Then the
Alumina/Pd-Ni sample survived 2 weeks electrolysis and produce an excess heat power reaching 20-25 %
of the input power, equivalent to 300 ± 30 mW.

Comparison of calorimetry errors with excess power obtained in Foreground runs with the
Aumina/Pd-Ni cathode as well as the theoretical analysis of oxygen reduction in the electrolytic cell shows
that the excess heat measured during electrolysis is well above the error limit determined by both the
calorimetry accuracy and by a possible gas recombination.
