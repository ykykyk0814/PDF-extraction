This is an overview of our experimental activity during the last twelve years. We have been studying the Ni-H system at
temperatures of about 700 K. Our investigations have revealed several interesting effects:
a) energy production for long time
b) neutron emission
c) γ-ray emission
d) charged particles emission
e) appearance of elements other than Ni on the surfaces of Ni samples.
These experiments were performed in several laboratories: the greatest part in Siena but also in Bologna, Colleferro and
Pavia. A new laboratory in Colle Val d’Elsa (Siena) will become operative in the summer 2004.


Introduction
Several kinds of metal samples were used: pure Ni, Nickel alloys and Nickel plated, having cylindrical or planar
shape. In a typical experiment the samples were inserted in a cell, loaded with hydrogen at pressure in the range 100-
1000 mbar and kept at temperatures between 420 and 720 K1-4. The reported temperature range represents the optimum
choice for hydrogen loading in Nickel below a limit value 1000 K which guarantees the cell’s integrity. Experiments
were performed using three different kinds of cells built to hold one cylindrical sample, 4 cylindrical samples or three
planar samples. A schematic layout of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1.

1  Hydrogen loading
Before loading the cells with hydrogen, air is pumped out. In some cases annealing cycles were performed at
temperatures up to 820 K in vacuum and 720 K in hydrogen. The hydrogen loading in the metals is measured by the
pressure decrease inside the cells. We observed in the experiments various hydrogen loading rates and also a
temperature dependence. Such effect is clearly evident from Figure 2.

Figure 2. Hydrogen pressure (continuous curve) and Ni temperature (step curve) measured in a period of 10 days. The hydrogen loading depends on
the temperature and increases for T< 200  0C.

Figure 3. An example of fast hydrogen loading which corresponds to about 7000 mbar/day.

In this case, the mean loading rate resulted to be of the order of 50 mbar/day. The fast loading shown in Figure 3
corresponds to about 7000 mbar/day.

Figure 4. Pressure versus temperature plot showing a slow hydrogen loading. The pressure decrease which correspond to the temperature increase
cannot be explained by the gas laws.

The hydrogen absorption is not completely reversible: as shown in Figure 4, in a thermal cycle, the final pressure is
lower than the initial pressure at the same temperatures.
2  Excess heat production
Regardless of the cell type, excess heat production was detected using the same method. At the beginning of the
experiment, a set of calibration curves was constructed plotting the temperature of several reference positions as a
function of the input power9. A correction was done for the room temperature fluctuations.

Figure 5. Calibration curve (line connecting experimental points) and points corresponding to heat production. The distance measured on the
horizontal line directly provides the excess heat amount: in this case about 15 W.

A temperature increase with respect to the reference curve, at a given input power, is evidence for excess heat
production. In Figure 5, which refers to a cell with a cylindrical sample, shows the calibration curve (lower) and the
points corresponding to heat production (higher). The distance measured on the horizontal line directly provides the
excess heat amount. In two cases, a considerable amount of energy was produced4: a cell with a single cylindrical
sample (cell A) produced 900 MJ in 278 days; a second cell with four cylindrical samples (cell B) produced 600 MJ in
319 days. The samples were made of pure Ni, or an alloy of Ni, Cr, Mn and Fe.
3  Radiation emission
The excess energy release described in the previous section cannot be accounted for by any chemical reaction involving
the masses of Ni and H inside the cell. Therefore same kind of nuclear process should be taken into consideration. This,
in turn, justifies the search for radiation emission associated with the heat production. Several kind of detectors were

Figure 6. Four germanium γ-rays spectra: the upper curve (note the 411.8 keV peak) was obtained measuring the γ  emitted from a gold sheet placed
for 12 days near the cell A. The other curves correspond to laboratory background, gold sheet not irradiated, gold sheet after a 12 days exposition 10
m away from the cell.

used at this purpose: neutron detectors filled with 3He and shielded, for neutron thermalization, with paraffin or
polythene; NaI scintillation counters; a germanium detector; X-rays films; a cloud chamber.
In one case, during the period of heat production from cell A, neutron emission was detected both by the neutron
counters and the activation method5. For the latter, a gold sheet placed inside a paraffin box was kept near cell A. A
neutron capture transmutes 197Au into 198Au which emits, while decaying, a 411.8 keV γ-ray. We detected such γ-rays
with the germanium detector (Figure 6) and evaluated a neutron flux of about 6000 neutrons/s

Figure 7. NaI γ-rays spectrum showing a peak superimposed to the background. The insert, obtained by subtracting the background, shows the typical
structure of a γ-ray: photoelectric peak, Compton and backscattering peak.
In some other occasions, working with planar cells, γ-ray emission was detected with a NaI counter6. The spectrum
(Figure 7) shows, superposed to the background, a peak centered to 660±1 keV. The γ-ray emission lasted for a few
days and then ended.

Figure 8. Picture of a track of an ionizing particle emitted from the Nickel taken in a cloud chamber.

The cylindrical specimen which produced energy in cell A, at the end of experiment, was placed in a cloud
chamber. As shown in Figure 8, we observed tracks of charged particles coming from the specimen8. We checked that
no tracks were present when a reference nickel sample (not treated in a cell) was placed inside the cloud chamber.

Figure 9. A typical EDAX spectrum observed in a little spot, showing the existence on the surface of Na, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn.

At the end of each experiment, the sample surfaces were analyzed by using a SEM with an EDAX probe. Those
samples which produced energy or absorbed a considerable amount of hydrogen exhibited regions where elements not
present before the treatments were observed. Figure 9 is a typical EDAX spectrum of such regions. These elements are
usually found in little spots or corroded regions. We found F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn.
Apart from light elements, which are not detectable by SEM, we found all the elements lighter than Ni plus Cu and Zn,
except for Sc, Ti, V and Co7-8. Figure 10 is an optical image of one of those corroded regions where the above
mentioned elements are found.

4  New Laboratory in Colle Val d’Elsa
As a result of a collaboration between Siena University and Lumenergia (a firm based in Brescia), a new laboratory
with 400 m2 of floor space will begin activity in Colle Val d’Elsa, near Siena, by the end of 2004. In this new laboratory
a facility for Ni samples production (Figure 11) has been installed: it will be used to produce Ni samples for the next
experiments.
