Dear Jed Rothwell,

Greetings from Centre for Energy Research, Bangalore, India.

A short writ-up regarding the experiments carried at our centre and its results are given below. We
are happy to discuss further in this connection.

With Warm Regards

(Dr Prahlada Ramarao)

Generation of Excess Energy with (Ni+Pd) +H2/D2 system
Centre for Energy Research (CER) at Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-
VYASA) which is a deemed-to-be University at Bangalore, India started its research on Low
Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) in 2015. The team at CER tried different designs of custom
made reactors and has so far carried out more than 200 experiments with various
combinations of the active materials like Nickel (Ni), Palladium (Pd) with Lithium Aluminium
Hydride (LAH), Lithium and Hydrogen (H2)/Deuterium (D2) gas at different conditions.
Extensive studies and work was also carried out on instrumentation and data Acquisition to
capture the phenomena.
Some of the experiments showed positive result of generation of excess heat but could not
sustain for long mainly due to either breakage of the heating system or breakage of the
ceramic reactor itself. A new reactor was designed where Silicon Carbide (SiC) heater
replaced the kanthal wire as a heating element, which solved major issues related to the
failure of the heating element. This reactor too showed positive result by generating excess
energy for sufficiently longer period but the excess energy generated could not be tapped
for measurements. Custom made hardware and software were used to record all the
parameters as a function of time.
The team was happy with the results obtained by Prof. Tadahiko Mizuno where air-
calorimeter was used to tap the excess energy generated. His open invitation made the team
to think in the same direction and developed modified reactor and evolved the procedure
and protocol accordingly. The team conducted more than 15 experiments including
calibration (without active materials inside the reactor). Most of the experiments showed
generation of excess energy and continued to do so for months together for different input
powers to the heater (0, 25, 50 and 100W).

The generation of excess energy for one such
experiment is compared with the o/p of
calibration experiment and shown here. For an
input power of more than 100 W the
experiment with active materials showed more
o/p energy when compared to the calibration
run. For an i/p power up to 50 and in some
experiments up to 100 W the system generated
excess power of ~ 50%.
Similar results have been obtained about a
dozen times. Currently, the focus is on
increasing the efficiency and power output.
