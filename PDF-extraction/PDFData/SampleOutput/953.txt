1. Introduction 

In the study of the bulk properties of metal—hydrogen systems, two syn-
thetic techniques are commonly employed [1, 2] : Reaction of the metal 
with hydrogen gas, if necessary at elevated pressures, and the electrochemi-
cal insertion of hydrogen into the metal, which is usually carried out at 
atmospheric pressure. These techniques share a common problem: that of 
the convenient, reliable in situ measurement of the hydrogen/metal atomic 
ratio. In the case of the system of interest in this work, the H—Pd system, 
measurement of the electrical resistance of the sample has long been known 
to provide a solution to this problem, at least for H/Pd atomic ratios ("load-
ings") up to approximately 0.75, for which the necessary resistance-loading 
functionality has been obtained by a variety of analytical methods [2]. How-
ever, in the case of more highly-loaded compositions, as well as palladium 
alloy-hydrogen systems for which the sample resistance is known to vary 
with composition (e.g. [3 —8]), the detailed results of a direct experimental 
determination of the resistance-loading function at room temperature are 
not available. 

At 298 K, the Ad)-phase of the H—Pd system extends from a loading 
of approximately 0.61 to (at least) unity. Despite the wealth of published 
data and analysis which are available for the a- and two-phase regions in 
the H—Pd system, relatively fewer studies have been reported for the 
fl-phase. This is particularly so for more highly loaded compositions (with 
H/Pd in excess of 0.8), for which the chemical potential of dissolved hydro-
gen increases rapidly with increasing concentration such that, in the case of 
loading from the gas phase at 298 K, a hydrogen partial pressure of 1 bar 
is sufficient to achieve H/Pd = 0.72 [9-11], whereas a pressure in excess 
of 12 kbar is required to reach H/Pd = 1 [12] (n.b. in most gas-loading 
experiments, the system pressure is indistinguishable from the hydrogen 
partial pressure; this latter quantity will henceforth be referred to here as 
"pressure" unless further clarification is required). The attainment by elec-
trochemical means of such elevated chemical potentials of dissolved hydro-
gen, with the resulting high loadings, is a subject of continued interest (e.g. 
[13, 14]). At this point, we should emphasize that the pressure-composition 
data quoted above refer to samples with low surface area to volume ratios. 

As the particle size decreases, the presence of increasing quantities of 
chemisorbed hydrogen, as well as the involvement of sub-surface hydrogen, 
serve to modify the pressure-composition isotherms. This subject has been 
discussed by Wicke [15]. 

Although the qualitative form of the resistance-loading function for the 
fl-phase of the H—Pd system has been described previously (e.g. [16, 17]) 
and is not under discussion here, several differing quantitative descriptions 
have been employed in earlier studies (e.g. [3, 13, 14]). In order to clarify 
this situation and facilitate the study of the H—Pd system at high loadings, 
here we review briefly relevant data taken from the literature and employ 
selected results in order to construct the resistance-loading function at 
298 K. 


2. Derivation of resistance-loading function 

At 298 K, the variation of electrical resistance ratio (R/R°, where R denotes 
the sample resistance and R° is that of the hydrogen-free metal at the outset 
of the experiment) of fl-phase H—Pd samples with imposed pressure, up to 
25 kbar, has been determined [3, 4, 7, 8, 18]; the results of two of these 
studies [4, 8] are shown in Fig. 1. As the pressure increases above approxi-
mately 10 bar, the resistance falls, eventually achieving values which are 
actually less than that of the hydrogen-free metal at the outset of the experi-
ment. For compositions within the fl-phase, measurements made during both 
absorption and desorption of hydrogen exhibited negligible hysteresis, as is 
commonly observed if the extensive formation of compositions within the 
a + /3 two-phase region is avoided during cycling.

rithm of hydrogen partial pressure (p) in the fl-phase of the H—Pd system, at 298 K 
unless otherwise stated. • Loading data from Ref. [19] (290 K); 0 Loading data from 
Ref. [10] (298 K, interpolation of original data); • Loading data from Ref. [9] (298 K, 
interpolation of original data); A Loading data from Ref [11]; IN Loading data from 
Ref. [12]; 0 Resistance data from Ref. [4]; • Resistance data from Ref. [8]. 

In order to make use of the resistance data shown in Fig. 1 for the 
determination of loading, we require the pressure-composition isotherm for 
the f--phase of the H—Pd system at 298 K. Several experimental data sets 
bear on this matter [9-12, 19]; unfortunately, only one relates to loadings 
in excess of 0.9, and, even at lower loadings, not all are consistent, Fig. 1. 

At lower loadings, the loading is seen to increase linearly with the logarithm 
of the pressure, an observation which has been the subject of extensive 
theoretical discussion [20]. The data of Perminov et al. [19] are significant 
in that, although clearly offset in loading from the other results shown in 
Fig. 1, their slope is similar and, most importantly, they indicate that the 
linear variation in fact extends to quite high pressures. 

Since, for hydrogen at 298 K, pressure and fugacity are effectively indis-
tinguishable up to pressures of approximately 100 bar, the observed linear 
variations of loading with the logarithm of pressure shown in Fig. 1 are 
equivalent to the statement that the loading varies linearly with the chemical 
potential of hydrogen in the fl-phase, at least over a certain range of compo-
sition. Some authors have chosen to extrapolate this latter relation in order

to calculate the resulting loadings at all pressures consistent with the exist-
ence of the fl-phase, via determination of the hydrogen fugacity correspond-
ing to a given pressure (e.g. [3, 4]). The loading data of Perminov et al., 
however, show a linear variation with the logarithm of pressure, rather than 
chemical potential, up to approximately 1700 bar at 290 K. In addition, the 
assumption of a linear variation of loading with chemical potential has been 
shown to be inapplicable to the experimental data of Tkacz and Baranowski 
for loadings greater than 0.9 [12]. 

With these considerations in mind, we have elected to adopt the results 
given by Frieske and Wicke [9] as representative of the more recent data

system at 298 K. 

sets shown in Fig. 1 in order to interconvert hydrogen pressure and loading, 
by extrapolation where necessary, over the entire loading range 0.61 to 0.9 
at 298 K. Further, we note: (i) The data of Frieske and Wicke give 0.72 as 
the loading at 1 bar; this value is an acceptable average of the more recent 
values reported in the literature, and (ii) when extrapolated, these data are 
consistent with the first data point of Tkacz and Baranowski (at H/Pd = 
0.9 in Fig. 1) [12]. This latter agreement must be regarded as somewhat :
fortuitous, however, since this particular loading was itself determined by 
an extrapolation procedure based on the low pressure data of Wicke and 
Nernst [10]. Nonetheless, the remainder of the loading data determined by 
Tkacz and Baranowski [12] were determined experimentally as differences 
in loading, measured relative to this initial point. 

Based on the considerations of the prior paragraph, and interpolating the 
data of Tkacz and Baranowski where necessary, the pressure-composition 
isotherm used in this work for the fl-phase at 298 K is illustrated in Fig. 2. 
Using this isotherm, the resistance-pressure results shown in Fig. 1 may be 
converted to resistance-loading data for the fi-phase at 298 K; these are 
plotted in Fig. 2. Also shown in Fig. 2, and described in detail in Table 1, 
is a single resistance-loading function which is designed to summarize the 
various available data sets. In obtaining this result, it was necessary to em- 
ploy additional data from the literature [8, 21-23] in order to define better 
the resistance-loading curve in the vicinity of the resistance maximum. 

These additional data, which are derived mostly from electrochemically-
loaded specimens, are also plotted in Fig. 2. 


3. Discussion 

In the summary resistance-loading function shown in Fig. 2, the maximum 
occurs at a loading of 0.76 (corresponding to a pressure of approximately
5 bar in a gas-loading experiment) and a resistance ratio of approximately 
1.81. Especially in the vicinity of this point, there is noticeable scatter in :
the resistance ratio values corresponding to a given loading for the various 
data sets shown in Fig. 2. This must be borne in mind when employing the 
summary resistance-loading function detailed in Table 1; in particular, these 
resistance data are quoted to three decimal places for future convenience 
in plotting, rather than as in indicator of reproducibility between different 
palladium samples. Similarly, the function given in Table 1 necessarily re-
fers to samples in internal compositional equilibrium; thus, it may not apply 
to specimens undergoing rapid changes in loading, for which significant 
internal compositional gradients may be expected, leading to a variable 
average sample resistance for a given total loading. 

The data at high loadings shown in Figs. 1 and 2 were obtained by gas-
loading at elevated pressures. Electrochemical loading, on the other hand, 
is usually undertaken at a hydrostatic pressure in the vicinity of one atmos-
phere. If, for the moment at least, we ignore the effects of internal micro-
structural variables on the measured resistance of a bulk fl-phase sample, 
this quantity may be taken as a function of temperature, composition and 
hydrostatic pressure. For a number of compositions, the magnitude of the 
rate of change of resistance ratio with hydrostatic pressure, at constant tem-
perature, has been determined to be on the order of 10' bar' [3, 4, 7]. 
Thus, the resistance-loading function shown in Fig. 2 will vary negligibly 
depending on the hydrostatic pressure entailed by the method of sample 
synthesis. 

It should be emphasized that the resistance of compositions within the 
fl-phase, rather than the resistivity, is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Data for the 
variation of resistivity with loading, up to values in the vicinity of unity, 
are available [16, 17]; unfortunately, these data are not easily compared 
with those discussed here due to uncertainties associated with the correc-
tions necessary as a result of changes in sample dimension as a function of 
loading. In addition, the resistivity data of Smith and Otterson [16] were 
obtained at 273 K. This temperature is sufficiently far removed from that 
employed here, 298 K, to require appropriate correction of the measured

data for comparative purposes, using the temperature coefficient of resis-
tance at constant composition. It appears, however, that values of this latter 
quantity are not available at high loadings [21]. 

While it is evident that a number of possible uncertainties have entered 
into the derivation of the pressure-composition isotherm shown in Fig. 2, 
mostly arising from the paucity of experimental data for loadings in excess 
of 0.8, its form warrants further comment. In the gas-loading procedure 
employed by Tkacz and Baranowski [12], the system pressure is indis-
tinguishable from the partial pressure of hydrogen. Under these circum-
stances, for the two-component H—Pd system, constancy of pressure over 
a range of composition is indicative of the presence of two phases. Although 
such behaviour is certainly not clearly evident in the data shown in Figs. 1 
and 2, the partial arrest in the rate of change of pressure with composition 
for loadings in the vicinity of 0.95 is intriguing in this respect. Further, 
corresponding data obtained over a range of temperatures [12] exhibit simi-
lar arrests. It is to be understood, however, that such data were obtained 
under exacting experimental conditions. 

While, in the absence of further data, any discussion of this aspect of 
the phase behaviour at very high loadings must be regarded as speculative, 
we note that binary phases in the H—Pd system with loadings greater than 
unity have been described [24-27], although under different preparative 
circumstances from those involved here. In addition, the (slight) change in 
the slope of the variation of resistance with pressure observed at approxi-
mately 10 kbar, Fig. 1, has been interpreted in terms of the occupation by 
hydrogen of a significant fraction of the tetrahedral sites within the pal-
ladium structure [4], although it is unclear whether loadings in excess of 
unity are achieved under these conditions. Finally, we note that single crys-
tal neutron diffraction studies of the fl-phase up to a loading of 0.92 showed 
no evidence for other than octahedral site occupancy [28].
